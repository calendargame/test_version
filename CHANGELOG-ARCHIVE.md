# Changelog archive

Retired entries from the in-app changelog (`src/changelog.ts`) — the plain-words "What's new"
list players read behind **⚙ Settings → Changelog**.

`src/changelog.ts` holds **at most ten day-entries, ever**. The popup renders that array as-is,
so anything left in the code file both ships to every visitor and gets drawn. When a new day
would make it eleven, the **oldest** entry moves out of the code file and into this one —
unchanged, keeping its ISO date and its lines verbatim, newest day first below.

This file is documentation only. **No source file imports it**, it lives outside `public/`, and
the build never touches Markdown, so not one byte of retired history reaches the bundle. The rule
lives with the data, in the charter comment at the top of `src/changelog.ts`.

## Retired entries

_None yet._ The code file currently holds fewer than ten days, so nothing has aged out. Entries
begin arriving here the first time a new day pushes the list past ten — at which point this note
is replaced by the entries themselves.
