// The changelog + update-signal dots (round-6 Q6). src/changelog holds the hand-maintained
// plain-words per-DAY entries (newest first; a second same-day deploy RESTATES that day's net
// effect versus production inside the one entry rather than prepending a second log — the round-7
// combine policy, ordering amended in round-11 Q6 — so dates stay unique). Round-8 Q8 made that
// array the published set exactly: the popup renders CHANGELOG as-is, so the ten-day cap is
// enforced at SOURCE (pinned below) and the oldest entry moves to CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md instead of
// piling up here. That retired the render-time slice, and with it the separate changelogLimit.dom
// file which mocked a larger data set behind that slice — the popup can no longer discard
// anything, so the cap can no longer be a rendering question. The two light-blue dots are the persisted
// breadcrumb to the popup. ⚠ THE TWO NO LONGER FIRE TOGETHER (2026-08-10): the Q2 build-stamp
// detection marks the GEAR flag on every build change (including one the real Updating flow just
// bridged — only the SCREEN is suppressed then), but marks the CHANGELOG flag only when the newest
// entry has actually changed since this device last looked. The cases that discriminate are below,
// and they matter because the pre-existing "lights BOTH" case passes either way: it stores no
// signature, which is the migration branch, where the old behaviour is deliberately preserved.
// Opening ⚙ Settings retires the gear's dot, and the first tap on the footer's Changelog link
// (right of Check for updates) retires the link's. The popup follows the established settings-
// modal contract (focus-on-open, capture Escape, close-with-settings, Android Back, the shared
// Tab trap, the [data-settings-modal] marker). Round-8 Q7 split the one dot into the two forms
// its two hosts can actually carry (components/UpdateDot: a corner badge for the ⚙ icon button,
// an in-flow marker for the text link), so the assertions below read the marker element's own
// data-update-dot / data-lit attributes — the host's className no longer says anything about it.
// Visual truth — where the dot lands, coexistence with the violet bar, themes — is on-device
// territory per the standing lesson; these tests pin the logic and the DOM-level rendering.
