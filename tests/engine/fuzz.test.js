// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// tests/engine/fuzz.test.js — the fuzz / bug survey of June 2026, EXPANDED in the giant bug pass.
//
// Drives the shared game reducer through MILLIONS of random-but-valid action sequences, covering
// every mode's action pattern and every settings toggle mid-play, and after EVERY action asserts
// the engine's invariants (engine/invariants.ts) still hold. This is two things at once:
//   1. A BUG HUNT — any impossible score (good>played, …) or desynced history fails the test with
//      a reproducible {profile, seed, step}.
//   2. The VALIDATION that the production tripwires never false-fire — if any invariant fired during
//      correct play, it would fail HERE first, so a green run proves the tripwires are safe to ship.
//
// The deterministic generator + the weighting profiles + the strong score oracle now live in the
// importable harness (tests/engine/fuzzHarness.js) so standalone sweep/debug scripts share them.
// This file just runs each profile and asserts profile-specific COVERAGE (so a profile can never pass
// by silently never reaching its target corner).
//
// ── WEIGHTING PROFILES ──
// The original survey used ONE uniform action distribution, which under-samples the rare COMPOUND
// sequences where the first score bugs lived. So the survey runs WEIGHTED profiles, each a weighted
// action table + flag probabilities, sharing one runSequence:
//   • uniform           — the original even distribution (broad, unbiased corpus).
//   • override-heavy     — biases OVERRIDE + the actions that make cards to toggle + BACK → every
//                          card the button can point at (browsed, live, retro), both directions.
//   • aox-complete-heavy — biases ANSWER.complete + OVERRIDE.hold → the AoX run-completion corner.
//   • reveal-heavy       — biases the "clean correct on the grid WITHOUT credit" seeds → the false-
//                          credit family the first fuzz caught.
//
// ── STRONG oracle + extra profiles + a sweep knob (the deeper pass, since extended) ──
// The checks above are INEQUALITIES (good≤played, streak/best/times≤good): they catch IMPOSSIBLE
// states but not "merely WRONG" ones. So the strongOracle profiles add an EXACT oracle
// (checkStrongScoreOracle): good must EQUAL the reconstructed credit count (an independent cross-check
// — good is only ever maintained incrementally), plus best and clean-edge streak.
//   • classic-strict — balanced Classic/Deduction play under the strong oracle.
//   • deep-history   — long (600-step) sequences over DEEP stacks under the strong oracle.
//   • times-churn    — heavy solve-time + tracking churn → hammers the times pool (its play order —
//                      gameReducer.poolSlot — held exactly by the invariants' times ledger).
//   • aox-strong — the AoX `complete` (held completing solve) surface. The oracle now
//     folds the HELD live credit (a clean credit on the live grid) and the back-browsed isLive forward
//     entry into the reconstruction, so the exact check runs where it previously couldn't. Still
//     excludes RESET_ROUND (keeps stats while wiping history) and the timeouts — unreachable in real
//     AoX play.
//   • timed-strong — the Blitz timeout surface (LOCK_REVEAL / TIMEOUT_MISS, gated to the
//     active live edge so they stay oracle-safe). Flash's scoring surface IS Classic's, so it's
//     already covered by classic-strict et al.; this adds exact coverage of the two timeout actions.
// Sweep knob: `FUZZ_SCALE=N npx vitest run tests/engine/fuzz.test.js` multiplies every profile's
// sequence COUNT by N (committed default 1) so a "bigger one-time sweep" needs NO code edit.
//
// Deterministic seeds ⇒ any failure reproduces exactly (the failure prints profile + seed + step).

// These profiles are deliberately heavy (millions of reducer calls), so they routinely exceed
// vitest's 5s default per-test timeout — especially under full-suite CPU contention. Give them an
// explicit, generous budget, scaled with the sweep size (SCALE, imported from the harness) so a
// FUZZ_SCALE big-sweep doesn't trip it. A sweep can also pass `--testTimeout=…`.
// ⚠ THE BUDGET IS A HANG DETECTOR, NOT A SPEED ASSERTION, and it has to leave real room. It was 30s
// when a profile took about 5s. Each step now does two to three times the checking — the calendar
// checks on every card, the reference model compared every step, every state frozen all the way
// down — so the heaviest profiles take 14–16s alone on the development laptop, and one reached 36s
// in a full-suite run on a busy machine: a red suite with nothing wrong. Where the added time went
// was measured before this was touched (two avoidable costs were removed; what is left is the new
// coverage itself). Per-dispatch cost in the app is a separate matter and is measured in
// microseconds. If a profile ever needs more than this, look for a real slowdown first.
