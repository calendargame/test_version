// Regression tests for the score-integrity bugs the fuzz survey found + fixed (2026-06-06).
// Each is a focused, app-reachable sequence that produced an IMPOSSIBLE score (streak/best > good)
// before the fix — and slipped past the earlier good≤played checks. The fuzz (tests/engine/fuzz) is
// the broad net; these pin the exact scenarios so a future regression names itself.
//
// Root cause (all in one family): a history entry's `hasCredit` ("earned a point") was inferred from
// the answer grid, but REVEAL / Show Codes / timeout / a reversed-to-wrong Override all leave a clean
// 'correct' on the grid WITHOUT crediting good. A later Override that recomputes the streak from
// history then counted those false credits. Fixed in gameReducer.advance (hasCredit gated on
// !revealed && !countedWrong) + Path 2's best/btns revert + TIMEOUT_MISS marking revealed.
//
// ⚠ "PATH 1…5" BELOW ARE HISTORICAL NAMES. Until round 23 the Override was five hand-written
// paths; it is now ONE per-card toggle (gameReducer's OVERRIDE, targeted by overrideTarget). Each
// regression keeps the name of the path it was found in because that is how the bug was reported,
// and each still drives the same sequence against the toggle: Path 1 is today's 'browsed' target,
// Paths 2/3 are the 'live' target (taking a held credit away / crediting a burned card), and Paths
// 4/5 are the 'retro' target (the card just behind a fresh live question).
