// tests/engine/blitzBest.test.js — C2 Part 2: the Blitz Best-record reconcile (the COMPONENT wrapper
// layer the pure-reducer fuzz never sees), tested directly + fuzzed against an independent oracle.
//
// reconcileBlitzBest / reconcileSuddenBest are the exact functions BlitzMode's `timerDone` effect calls
// (extracted from main.tsx), so this drives the real wrapper logic — no model, no drift — without the
// cost of rendering <App/>. The independent oracle: across a session of rounds (each reaching a peak
// good, then possibly overridden DOWN), the Best Score must always equal the MAX good any round
// actually reached. A reconcile/rollback bug — fabricating a Best, or (the C2 bug) dropping it below an
// earlier round when a later round is overridden down — breaks that equality. The end-to-end
// reachability of the same bug through the real UI is pinned by blitz.dom "Best Score cross-round
// rollback".
