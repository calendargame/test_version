// tests/engine/cardCalendar.test.js — ONE CARD, ONE CALENDAR (CardMeta.jul).
//
// A date on or before October 4, 1582 has two weekdays — its Julian one and its Gregorian one — and
// the Julian Calendar setting can be switched while a date is on screen. The defect this pins shut: a
// date drawn under one setting and answered under the other was judged by the setting at the answer
// and stored with the calendar it was DRAWN under, so browsing back to it showed a green answer and
// Show Codes for two different calendars.
//
// The rule now: the first thing that JUDGES a card stamps the calendar onto it, and everything that
// judges, shows or re-derives that card afterwards reads the stamp (gameReducer's calendarOf). These
// are the named cases — every judging action, every reader, and what the restore door does with a
// card an older build parked without a stamp. engine/invariants holds every state to the same rule
// and the fuzz's reference model keeps its own copy of it (tests/engine/referenceModel).
