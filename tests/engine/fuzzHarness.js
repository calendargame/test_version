// weekdays and the Julian Calendar setting, which the driver switches mid-sequence (pJulianFlip),
// decides which is the answer. That is the ground a card's calendar (CardMeta.jul) is proved on: a
// date drawn under one setting, judged under another, overridden and browsed under a third. `_jul`,
// the setting at the draw, is random on purpose — nothing may judge by it.
// ★ …AND SOME ARE DATES ONLY THE JULIAN CALENDAR HAS — February 29 of a year that is a leap year by
// the Julian rule alone (the list below is the harness's own, written out, not the app's function).

// draw it records (`_jul: true`); the driver then switches the setting off over it like over any
// other date, and half the time plays the screen's part (the ⚙ panel closing: a waiting date the
// calendar in force lacks is regenerated) and half the time does not (a clock running out behind the
// open panel) — so such a date is judged with the setting off too, and must come out a Julian card.

// ── The STRONG, EXACT score oracle (strongOracle profiles only) ────────────────────────────────
// Reconstructs the chronological credit sequence INDEPENDENTLY of the reducer's incrementally-
// maintained good/streak/best, then cross-checks good == credits, best == longest run, and (at a
// clean live edge) streak == trailing run. The sequence walks the same cards the reducer's
// creditSequence does — back-stack ++ the browsed question ++ the de-reversed non-live forward-stack —
// PLUS the LIVE question's own credit, re-derived here rather than read from any reducer helper:
//   • Not browsing: a HELD live credit (AoX `complete`, or a crediting Override that held — a
//     credit that STAYED on the question instead of advancing) sits at the live edge, not in the
//     stack. It is re-derived from the grid and the two flags (a green with no red, not revealed,
//     not burned), and was scored only if Save Stats was on for it (saveStatsThisQ).
//   • Browsing: the question we backed away from is parked in forwardStack as the isLive entry; the
//     base walk excludes it (filter !isLive) and we fold its true contribution back in at the newest
//     slot via liveCredit — 'credit' → a credit, 'miss' → a played non-credit, null → not played.
// This widens the exact oracle from the no-complete Classic/Deduction surface onto the AoX-complete
// reducer surface. It stays OFF for the RESET_ROUND profiles — RESET_ROUND keeps stats
// while wiping the history (good != reconstructed by design).
//
// liveCredit / heldLiveCredit are re-implemented here (NOT imported from the reducer's liveCredited /

//     so is the card's grid, a crossed Override mark included;
//   • it says neither (a live date holding wrong picks that are neither calendar's answer), and the
//     card is overridden: the Override's mark is all there is, so the card comes back in the calendar
//     that mark names — the original's, or the other one when the mark was crossed — grid untouched;
//   • it says neither, and the card is not overridden: the calendar it was drawn under — nothing on
//     the card says more (and a date only the Julian calendar has was drawn under that one);
//   • wherever the two calendars name the same answer, either calendar is right — the green cannot
