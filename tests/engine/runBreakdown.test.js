// tests/engine/runBreakdown.test.js — the run breakdown's two claims (sub-group 3C).
//
// CLAIM 1 (the point of the whole thing): THE ROWS RECONCILE EXACTLY WITH THE MEAN. The breakdown
// is not a report about the run, it is the run's own decomposition — so the row times, in order,
// must equal `stats.times` after ANY sequence of moves, and the row-derived mean must therefore be
// the same number the stat strip prints. Every case below re-asserts it through one shared helper,
// including every Override target and its Undo, because Override is where this app's hardest bugs
// live and it is the only thing that can move a time from one card to another (or take one away).
//
// CLAIM 2: the rows are the run, in order, and each one says what it is — its number, its date, the
// weekday that date fell on (in the calendar the card was JUDGED in), its time, and a mark when it
// earned nothing.
//
// CLAIM 3 (round 22): a FAILED MoX run is a run like any other — every way a run can fail leaves the
// failing card as its last row, marked and untimed, with the rows still reconciling to the mean.
//
// The engine-level tripwire for claim 1 lives in checkGameInvariants ('times ledger'), which the
// fuzz survey drives across millions of generated games; these are the named, readable cases.
