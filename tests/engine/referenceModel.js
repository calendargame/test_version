// tests/engine/referenceModel.js — the fully-INDEPENDENT reference score model.
//
// A second, separately-written implementation of the game's SCORING CONTRACT that replays the same
// action stream as the reducer and computes the expected stats from its own per-question ledger —
// WITHOUT the reducer's stack/forwardStack, hasCredit flags, grids, or Override records. The fuzz
// (fuzzHarness.js, referenceModel profiles) compares the two after every action.
//
// WHY a second model when the strong oracle already cross-checks: the strong oracle reconstructs
// `good` from the reducer's own per-entry hasCredit flags — it catches aggregate-vs-flag DESYNCS
// (every bug so far) but would miss a state where the aggregate AND the flag are wrong TOGETHER
// (e.g. an override crediting a question that semantically shouldn't credit, setting both).
// This model re-derives what SHOULD be credited from the user-visible rules alone, so that class
// disagrees here. It also asserts `played` — which no prior oracle checked at all.
//
// INDEPENDENCE BOUNDARY (designed, not accidental): the model consumes only DISPLAY facts —
// the QUESTION a player can read off the screen, never scoring state:
//   • the question itself — its date, or a puzzle's options and the calendar it was built in — as
//     each one arrives: `next` from an advancing action's nextDate, and `liveAfter` from the screen
//     after a Reset / regen (which date survives those is a VIEW rule about the displayed question,
//     so the model reads the outcome rather than re-deriving keep-vs-replace nuances);
//   • per ANSWER, the option clicked — and the model works out FOR ITSELF whether it is right, with
//     its own calendar arithmetic (refWeekday below: the platform's Date for the Gregorian calendar,
//     Zeller's congruence for the Julian one — neither is the app's Julian-Day-Number formula).
//   • Everything else — per-question credit/burn/freeze state, the browse cursor, which question
//     the Override button points at and what a press does to it, played/good/streak/best/times
//     derivation — is modeled here from first principles (the contract: How-to-Play + the
//     characterization tests), sharing ZERO code with the reducer (even the streak walk is
//     re-implemented inline).
//
// THE MODEL: questions live in `history` (every question ADVANCED PAST that was scored, in order)
// plus the single `live` slot. Browsing is just a cursor (0 = the live edge; k = standing on
// history[length-k]) — entries never move (unlike the reducer's stack↔forwardStack shuffle).
// Stats are DERIVED, never maintained:
//   played = scored questions  ·  good = credited questions  ·  times = the credited contributions
//   best = the longest credit run in question order  ·  streak = the trailing run (clean edge only)
//
// Per-question scoring rules (the contract):
//   • A question is SCORED (counts a played) by its FIRST stat action — answer / Reveal / Show
//     Codes on the live question / per-question timeout — IF Save Stats was effectively on; that
//     first action FREEZES the question's Save-Stats (ssFrozen), so a later toggle can't re-score
//     or un-score it. One played per question, ever.
//   • ★ THE OVERRIDE, IN THIS MODEL'S OWN VOCABULARY (round 23): each question keeps the facts of
//     how it was ANSWERED — `aCredited` (a clean first-try correct that counted), `aTime` (that
//     answer's recorded solve time), `wrongTime` (the first miss's time) — which the Override NEVER
//     touches, plus ONE bit, `overridden`, which is all the Override ever flips. So:
//         credited = aCredited XOR overridden
//     and a credited question contributes `aTime` when not overridden, or `oTime` when it is — the
//     overridden credit's time, taken from `wrongTime` (when tracked) the first time an overridden
//     question counts as credited, and never re-taken. The reducer stores two materialised states
//     and rewrites grids, flags and times on every press; this model stores the answer once and
//     flips a bit. Two mechanisms, one contract — which is the point: if they ever disagree about a
//     score, a time or which question the button means, the ref profiles say so.
//   • WHICH QUESTION the button means (the model's reading of the UI contract): the browsed
//     question when browsing; otherwise the live question when it was scored AND it has something
//     to override (it was answered wrong / revealed / shown the codes, it holds a credit on screen,
//     or it is already overridden) — a pristine per-question timeout does not; otherwise the most
//     recent history question. A question the clock timed out on untouched is never the one,
//     wherever it sits: browsed to, or as the newest history question, the button means nothing. A press on the live question moves play on only when it credits a
//     question that was not overridden and the driver did not ask to hold (`hold`); nothing else
//     ever moves, and an Undo never does.
//   • An overridden live question is resolved on screen: locked either way, and when the override
//     took its credit away, the answer is shown and it counts as burned. Its as-answered flags are
//     still there underneath, untouched, for the Undo to fall back onto.
//   • Only SCORED questions enter history on advance (an unscored question vanishes — it was never
//     played); LOCK_REVEAL resolves a question without scoring it.
//   • ★ THE CALENDAR (round 24). A date on or before October 4, 1582 has two weekdays, and the
//     Julian Calendar setting can be switched at any moment. The contract: a question has ONE
//     calendar, fixed by the FIRST thing that judges it — an answer right or wrong, a Reveal, a Show
//     Codes that shows the answer, either timeout — as the setting stood at that moment (`jul`); a
//     Deduction puzzle's is the one it was built in. Every later judgement of that question, and
//     everything that shows it, reads that. So the model decides right-or-wrong in `jul`, and
//     compareRefModel holds the reducer to two things per question, in play order: the calendar it
//     stamped, and that the answer its grid marks is the model's own answer in that calendar.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
