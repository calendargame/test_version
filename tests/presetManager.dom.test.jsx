//
// presetManager.dom — MANAGING PRESETS (components/PresetManager), the ⚙ menu's fifth modal.
//
// ★ WHAT THIS FILE OWNS AND WHAT IT LEAVES ALONE. It covers the four things this card does — make,
// rename, reorder, delete — and the two cases the brief called out as real and easy to fake:
// deleting the ACTIVE preset, and deleting the LAST one. It does NOT re-test the modal CONTRACT
// (focus on open, Escape, Android Back, the Tab trap, the scrim, the [data-settings-modal] marker):
// this modal is registered in tests/helpers/settingsPanel's MODAL_TITLES, so every MODAL_KEYS loop
// in tests/settingsPanel.lifecycle and tests/settingsPanel.defaults already drives it alongside the
// other four, which is a stronger claim than a copy of those cases here would be — it says this
// modal behaves like the app's other modals, rather than that somebody wrote it four assertions.
// It does not re-test the store either: tests/presets.dom owns what a switch does to saved data.
//
// ⚠⚠ WHAT NO CASE HERE CAN PROVE, said plainly rather than implied. jsdom has NO LAYOUT ENGINE. It
// does not lay out the row's flex box, it does not resolve the card's max-w or the list's max-h, it
// reports every width and height as 0, and it never scrolls. So: whether the three small row
// buttons are comfortable under a thumb, whether a typed name fits beside them at 360px, whether
// the list's scroll region ever shows its fades, and whether a newly created preset scrolls into
// view are ALL DEVICE QUESTIONS and only the owner's iPhone can answer them. What is asserted below
// is the structure and the behaviour those outcomes rest on.
// ⚠ AND — SPECIFICALLY FOR THE RENAME FIELD'S WIDTH CAP (round 20) — lib/presetNameWidth's own
// measurement is MOCKED in this file rather than exercised for real: jsdom has no canvas either
// (verified in tests/presetNameWidth.dom, which owns the real mechanism end to end, fake canvas and
// all), so what belongs here is narrower — does PresetManager's onChange call that function with
// the typed candidate and TRUST its answer, does the width-language note track `capped` for the
// right row and no other, does it clear on commit and on discard. The measurement itself is a
// different file's claim to make.
