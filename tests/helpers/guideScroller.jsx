// THE GUIDE'S SCROLLER, as an ABSTRACTION — the one place in the suite that is allowed to know
// HOW How to Play scrolls.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and what it has already done. It was written in round 13 group 2, one
// group ahead of the move it was built for: the guide used to be the only screen that did not
// scroll an inner box (<html data-doc-scroll> released the app's three clamps and the DOCUMENT
// scrolled it), and it was about to be moved onto App's #appScroll container like everything else.
// A behaviour test that read window.scrollY, document.scrollingElement or the attribute would have
// had to be rewritten on the far side, which is exactly the situation rule 10 exists to prevent: a
// safety net you have to edit is not a safety net. So the net asks this file the questions instead
// — "where is the reader", "how much content is there", "how strong is each edge indicator", "what
// has the app written" — and this file answered them against whichever scroller was live, by
// walking up from the guide's own root for the shared SCROLLER_CORE_CLASS token and falling back
// to the document when it found none.
//
// THE MOVE HAS LANDED, and tests/guideScroll.dom passed it unchanged — all 34 of it, which was the
// move's proof. The document fallback is therefore unreachable, and unreachable code modelling an
// architecture the app no longer has is precisely the kind of leftover this project does not keep.
// It is gone; what remains is the same abstraction with one backing. The BEHAVIOUR net still names
// no mechanism, and this file is still the only place that may.
//
// WHAT ELSE THE MOVE PUT HERE: renderGuidePage, at the foot of the file. The guide stopped being a
// component you can render on its own the moment it started taking the scroller as a prop, so the
// two files that render it without App (tests/expander.dom, tests/dotDiagram.dom) come through
// here for the mount. Same charter, one sentence wider: how How to Play scrolls, and what it takes
// to stand one up.
//
// ⚠ THE MODEL IS STATEFUL, AND DELIBERATELY SO. jsdom lays nothing out, so a real scroller has to
// be stood up by hand — and the suite's habit of stubbing one number per test is what let three
// scroll bugs ship (the round-10 resting-state shadow, both round-11 freezes). This models the
// thing rather than the read: the app's own writes MOVE it, a test's scroll MOVES it, and every
// read — the app's and the test's — comes back from the same number. That is what lets a test say
// "the reader is still at 640" instead of "el.scrollTop was assigned 640", which is the difference
// between a behaviour pin and a mechanism pin.
//
// ⚠ AND A HIDDEN SCREEN REPORTS 0, which is the model's one piece of real platform fidelity and it
// is load-bearing. A display:none element has no layout, so its scrollTop is 0 — flatly, on every
// engine. So the app CANNOT read the guide's reading position after React has hidden it; it has to
// take the number synchronously, inside the event that switches the mode. Modelling that here is
// what makes "the reader's place survives a detour" a discriminating test instead of a formality:
// an implementation that read the position one commit late would capture 0 and land the reader at
// the top, and the net would catch it. (It was true of the document scroller too — a re-clamped
// document collapsed to a screenful and clamped its offset the same way — so this survived the
// move as an argument, not just as code.)

// ── Mounting the guide on its own ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE ONE WAY A TEST MAY RENDER GuidePage WITHOUT App, and the reason this file owns it: since
// round 13 the guide does not know how to scroll itself. App hands it `scrollerRef`, the ref to the
// one #appScroll box, and the coordinator dereferences that ref on every header tap. A bare
// `render(<GuidePage visible />)` therefore hands the coordinator `undefined` and every tap throws
// — which the suite could not see, because the throw lands AFTER the state flip, so the assertions
// still passed while the run exited non-zero and the whole second half of the coordinator went
// unexercised. Making the prop optional would have hidden the same class of mistake in production
// (App forgetting the ref would silently cost the guide its glides), so the prop stays required and
// the mount comes here instead, where "how How to Play scrolls" already lives.
//
// The harness is App's own shape, minus everything the guide does not read: the scroller carrying
// the shared overflow token (so scrollerAncestor resolves it exactly as it does in the app tree),
// the max-width content wrapper the model treats as the growing content, and the guide inside.
// The scroller is stood up with real EXTENT because that is the coordinator's second precondition
// — a scroller reporting scrollHeight 0 is one it refuses to glide — so a tap in a caller of this
// runs the whole callback rather than stopping at the guard.
// `visible` is fixed at true: the model resolves and reports against a screen that is on show, so a
// hidden standalone guide is not a state this harness can describe. Whether the guide survives
// being hidden is a MODE question, and mode belongs to App — tests/guideScroll.dom asks it there.
