// THE ⚙ SETTINGS PANEL, as an ABSTRACTION — the one place in the suite that is allowed to know
// WHERE the panel lives and HOW it is reached.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is the same reason tests/helpers/guideScroller.jsx exists. The
// panel is about to be lifted out of the 2,287-line App component in src/main.tsx, and the gate on
// that move is falsifiable and absolute: THE BEHAVIOUR NET PASSES WITH ZERO EDITS. A test that has
// to be edited on the far side of a move proves nothing about the move — it proves only that
// somebody made it green again. Round 13 established the pattern (the guide's scroller was
// abstracted one group AHEAD of the move it was built for, and passing unchanged is what made that
// round trustworthy); this is the same play for the settings panel.
//
// So before a single line of main.tsx is restructured, every existing test that was written
// against WHERE the panel lives — its DOM nesting, its harness, the class string that dims a
// button — is rewritten to ask this file instead. The questions the net asks are the user's:
// "open the panel", "what is the switch for Save Stats", "is Reset Settings offered", "is this
// picker locked", "which modal is up". None of them names a component, a parent element, or a
// Tailwind token. This file answers them, and this file is the only one that may.
//
// ⚠ THE RULE FOR THIS FILE IS THAT IT MAY CHANGE AND NOTHING ELSE MAY. If the extraction breaks a
// resolution here, fix it here — that is the whole point, and it is why the resolutions below
// prefer CONTRACTS the app states out loud (the popover's id, a control's accessible name, a
// role) over positions in a tree, which is what a move actually disturbs.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE MUST NOT SWALLOW. The PIXEL GATES describe at the foot of tests/settings.dom is
// the owner's deliberate zero-pixel-movement gate and is INTENTIONALLY implementation-coupled — it
// asserts child counts, element identity, and exact className strings. Those tests do NOT come
// through here, they say so themselves, and routing them through an abstraction would delete the
// only thing they do.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE STILL CANNOT DO, so no group of the net may imply it does. jsdom has no layout
// engine and no pointer engine. Three panel behaviours are therefore DEVICE CHECKS and nothing
// here pretends otherwise: the footer's auto-fit (fitFooterBtns measures at width 0, so it is a
// no-op in every test), the press-drag gestures as GESTURES (the geometry — hit-testing, the
// edge-band auto-scroll, the feel), and whether the gear's onPointerDown + onClick pair
// double-toggles on real touch hardware. What IS reachable here is the controller's DECISIONS —
// installPointerGestures runs against the real document, so a press-drag release can be driven
// end-to-end with the hit-test supplied (pressDragFromGear below). That is a real gesture, not a
// state poke, and it is the only form of one this environment can deliver honestly.

// THE RECONCILED RESET LIST, and it is a decision rather than a union taken by accident.
//
// The seven files that drove the panel each reset a different subset, and the differences were
// historical, not meaningful: every one cleared localStorage and the settings store; four also
// cleared the saved-defaults snapshot; two also cleared sessionStorage; several repeated the two
// resets tests/setup/dom.js ALREADY performs before every test in the suite (progress and mode
// prefs — see its foot).
//
// What is load-bearing is `clearDefaults()`. The four stores are in-memory module singletons
// hydrated at import, so localStorage.clear() does NOT put the saved snapshot back to null — a
// test that saves personal defaults leaks them into every later test in its file unless the store
// itself is cleared. Three of the seven files omitted it and got away with it only because they
// never save a snapshot. Including it costs those three nothing and removes the trap.
//
// sessionStorage is DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. It is not app state — it holds the post-update
// splash-skip flag and the update-attempt loop breaker (src/main.tsx), which only the two files
// that mount across a simulated build change care about. Those two keep their own explicit
// sessionStorage.clear(), where it reads as the setup for the thing they are testing instead of

// ── Android Back, and the jsdom trap underneath it ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE PROBLEM, and it is entirely an artefact of the test environment — nothing here is a claim
// about the app. Closing an overlay through the UI runs useBackButton's popOverlay, which sets a
// private `ignorePop` flag and calls history.back() to unwind the entry that overlay pushed. The
// resulting popstate is meant to arrive and be swallowed, clearing the flag. jsdom performs the
// traversal on a LATER task, so two things can go wrong before it does:
//   1. a synthetic Back fired in the meantime is swallowed by the pending flag INSTEAD — so the
//      panel does not close, and the real traversal closes something later, out of nowhere; and
//   2. worse, ANY pushState in the meantime CANCELS the queued traversal outright — so its
//      popstate never comes and the flag stays set FOREVER. Verified: open a modal, close it by
//      Escape, reopen it, press Back — the Back does nothing, and every later Back in that test is
//      one press behind. No amount of waiting fixes it; the event being waited for was cancelled.
//
// Both of these would have been rediscovered by whoever wrote the first Android-Back case, so the
// helper carries the whole problem and no case in the net has to know any of it.
//
// THE FIX IS A MIRROR OF THAT PRIVATE FLAG, kept honestly: it is set by exactly what sets the real
// one (a history.back() call) and cleared by exactly what clears it (the next popstate, whatever
// its origin). So after the wait, `backGuardArmed` says whether a guarded traversal was cancelled
// — and if it was, ONE sacrificial popstate consumes the stale flag without touching the overlay
// stack, because that is precisely what a set flag makes a popstate do. A boolean, not a count,
// because the flag it mirrors is a boolean: two cancelled traversals still leave one flag set, and
// a second sacrificial dispatch would eat a real overlay.
//
// The patch is installed once, at import, and it calls through — the app's own behaviour is
// untouched. It is per test FILE (each gets its own module registry), so nothing leaks sideways.

// ── The gestures every route is built from ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// A FINGER TAP on `el`, as the whole gesture rather than as the one event a handler happens to
// want. mousedown THEN click, because the panel has two listeners that fire on the press half and
// never see the click — the click-outside handler (document mousedown/touchstart) and the Full
// Reset disarm listener (document mousedown/touchstart, capture) — and a test that fired only
// `click` would report "tapping this control does not disarm Full Reset" as a pass.
//
// ⚠ KNOWN LIMIT, MUTATION-VERIFIED (round 14 review). Both halves fire inside ONE act(), so React
// never re-renders between them and a click handler still sees the state the press half wrote. That
// makes the Full Reset disarm listener testable in one direction only: severing it (never disarm)
// goes red as it should, but INVERTING it — disarming on every press including the confirming one —
// leaves the whole defaults suite green, because the click closure still reads fullResetArmed as
// true and fires the reset. On a real device the press and the release are separate tasks, so that
// inversion would re-arm instead of firing and Full Reset would become unfireable by any route.
// Closing it needs a variant that puts an act() boundary BETWEEN the halves for the confirming tap;

// A REAL PRESS-DRAG-RELEASE, starting on the ⚙ gear and ending wherever `target` resolves.
//
// This is the app's press-drag menu gesture end to end, against the REAL controller
// (installPointerGestures, mounted by App): pointerdown on the gear opens the panel, the finger
// travels into it, and the release acts on whatever is under it — clicking a pill and asking the
// panel to dismiss (data-drag-dismiss), clicking a footer control without dismissing
// (data-drag-stay), or focusing a year box for typing (data-drag-focus). Which of the three
// happens is the controller's decision, never this helper's; all this supplies is the hit-test
// jsdom cannot perform.
//
// `target` is a FUNCTION, not an element, and that is forced: the release target lives inside a
// panel that does not exist until the pointerdown has opened it. It is called once the panel is up.
//
// The events are hand-built MouseEvents carrying pointerId/isPrimary/pointerType — the recipe
// tests/pointerGestures.test.js proved — because jsdom ships no PointerEvent constructor, and both
// the gear's own guard and the controller's latch read those three fields.
//
// ⚠⚠ AFTER THIS RETURNS, THE NEXT CLICK ON THE GEAR IS SWALLOWED. Read this before writing any
// case that press-drags and then expects a later gear tap to do something.
//
// The gear carries `data-select-trigger` and toggles on POINTERDOWN, so the controller ALWAYS arms
// click suppression on it at release (src/lib/pointerGestures.ts — an unsuppressed click would
// double-toggle the panel). That arming is cleared by exactly three things: the click that
// consumes it, the next POINTERDOWN, or a 1s fallback timer. A real browser delivers the click and
// the arming dies with it. jsdom delivers nothing, and `tap()` fires mousedown + click — neither
// is a pointerdown — so the arming survives and eats that click in the capture phase. Under FAKE
// TIMERS the 1s fallback never fires either, so it survives indefinitely.
//
// The consequence is silent, which is what makes it worth a paragraph: `closeSettings()` defaults
// to a gear tap, so after a press-drag it is a NO-OP that throws nothing and leaves the panel open.
// A case that then reads something still rendered will pass while having closed nothing. So after
// a press-drag, either stand the app up again, or travel a route that is not a click
// (closeSettings('key')), and assert isSettingsOpen() so a regression fails loudly.

//   • name     — the accessible name, which is where BOTH signals are always readable, open or
//                closed. About a dozen helpers across five test files find the gear by this
//                string, so its format is load-bearing well beyond any one test.
//   • controls — the id the gear says its menu has, RAW: the string while the panel is open, null
//                while it is closed. Both answers are the contract (the press-drag controller
//                resolves this id live, so a gear that named a menu while none was mounted would
//                pair a gesture with nothing), so it is not collapsed to a boolean.
//
// ⚠ THE UPDATE DOT IS NOT HERE, it has its own accessor (gearDot below). tests/changelog.dom reads
// the marker's raw attributes (`toHaveAttribute('data-lit','false')`), which is the STRONGER form:
// 'true', 'false' and "no marker at all" are three different answers, and a boolean here would

// null (no marker on this host at all). The distinction is real and load-bearing: the inline
// marker beside the Changelog link reserves its slot in BOTH states so lighting up shifts nothing,
// while a host with no marker is a different failure entirely. A boolean would erase that.
//

//   2. IT USED TO CLOSE THE PANEL. The panel's document-level Escape handler carves out text inputs
//      by reading document.activeElement, and the box had already blurred itself by the time that
//      handler ran, so the carve-out no longer applied. The box now stops the press propagating.

// folded into openModal('save').
//
// Round 14 closed defect D7: all three ⚙ footer buttons now short-circuit their own handlers while
// they are dimmed, so Save Defaults opens its popup only while something actually diverges from the
// effective defaults. Before that, the dim was CSS-only and a programmatic press opened the popup
// from a pristine state — which is how a dozen cases whose SUBJECT is the popup (its chrome, its
// focus trap, its five dismiss routes) happened to reach it.
//
// Those cases need the divergence arranged, and it has to be a value they do not otherwise read, or
// the fixture starts answering the question. Jan/Feb Chance is that value: it is captured in the
// snapshot like any other panel setting, it is the one chance picker that NEVER locks, and no case
// in the net or in saveDefaults.dom.test.jsx asserts it. Call it, then open the popup.
//
// ⚠ It is NOT inside openModal on purpose. A helper that silently moved a setting to make a button
// work would hide state from the cases that go on to save a snapshot and read it back.
//
// ⚠ It asks the app what "default" currently MEANS rather than hard-coding the factory value,
// because several cases call it twice — once to reach the popup, and again after a Save has made
// the value it just moved the new saved default. A fixed literal would silently stop diverging.

// EVERY WAY A MODAL GOES AWAY, and the group asserts they are not interchangeable: four of them
// DISCARD pending edits and one of them (`save`) commits.
//   dismiss — the modal's own dismiss control, under whichever caption it currently wears. The
//             manager rests with a single 'Close' and swaps it for 'Cancel' the moment a row is
//             edited, so naming one caption would go blind in the state that matters.
//   save    — the commit control. Only the two DefaultsCard modals have one.
//   scrim   — a FINGER TAP on the backdrop. Cancels the POPUP only; the panel stays up behind it.
//             ⚠ IT IS `tap`, NOT `click`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE PAIRING. The modal's own dismiss
//             fires on click, but the claim "and the panel is still up behind it" is about the
//             panel's click-outside rule — which listens on document mousedown/touchstart and
//             never sees a click at all (src/main.tsx). A click-only route satisfies that half by
//             never consulting the rule, so it would report "panel survived" even with the rule's
//             `[data-settings-modal]` carve-out deleted. mousedown THEN click drives both.
//   escape  — the capture-phase handler, which consumes the press so the panel's own Escape never
//             sees it.
//   back    — Android hardware Back. LIFO: the modal goes first, the panel on the next press.
//             ⚠ ASYNC — `await closeModal(key, 'back')`; see pressBack for why.
//   panel   — closing the SETTINGS panel, which closes the modal as a child flow.
