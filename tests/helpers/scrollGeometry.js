// Scroll-geometry FIXTURES — the states jsdom cannot produce on its own and the suite has never
// rendered (round 11 Q4).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every scroll indicator in the app — the two mask fades, the bar's boundary
// shadow, the guide's doc-fade strips, Lookup's header/footer shadows — is a function of three
// numbers: scrollTop, scrollHeight, clientHeight. jsdom lays nothing out, so all three read 0
// unless a test stands them up by hand, and the tests that DO stand them up have always stood up
// the same one shape: a populated, comfortably overflowing region, driven by a scroll event.
//
// That gap is the actual recurring defect, and it has now shipped twice. Round 10: full-strength
// shadows framing an empty "No lookups yet" panel on every cold start of a fresh install — a
// RESTING state, which no fixture rendered, self-healing after the first lookup so an on-device
// pass missed it. Round 11 Q4: masks and fades frozen when content changed size without a scroll
// event — a TRANSITION, which no fixture performed. Each was answered with one more point test.
// This is the systematic replacement: name the states, and sweep the regions through them.
//
// Nothing here simulates layout. It supplies exactly what a real engine would supply and jsdom
// does not: the three numbers, and the notification that they changed.

// Stand up a scroller's geometry. scrollTop is a real stored property in jsdom; scrollHeight and
// clientHeight are read-only zeros, so they are defined as configurable getters — configurable so
// the same element can be moved from state to state (a growing accordion, a rotating viewport)
// rather than needing a fresh render per number.

// THE RESTING STATES: a scroller with no edge to signal. Every one of these must produce no mask,
// no shadow and no fade anywhere — `scrollEdgeGaps` collapses both gaps to 0 for all of them — and
// every one of them is a state the app is genuinely in on a cold start or a large screen. The
// suite rendered none of them before this round.

  ['content that exactly fits', { scrollTop: 0, scrollHeight: 600, clientHeight: 600 }],
  // The 1px slack in scrollEdgeGaps: a fractional content height against a fractional box height
  // reports a sliver of overflow forever, and for a progressive shadow that means a permanent
  // faint one. This is the state that regression lands in, so it is a fixture, not a footnote.

// fires, watching the correct element and watching the wrong one are indistinguishable. This one
// records what each observer holds and lets a test deliver a resize for one target, which is the
