// THE GAME SCREEN, read as the user reads it — the live question, and the stats strip.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT PART OF tests/helpers/settingsPanel.jsx. That file's own
// scope note refuses mode-screen accessors, and it is right to: it owns the ⚙ panel, and what a
// game screen shows is a different subject with a different lifetime. But a large part of the
// settings behaviour net is about a settings change REACHING the game screen — "the pick applies
// on close", "Save Stats withdraws the readouts", "Reset Settings did not remount the screen" — so
// the screen has to be readable somewhere shared.
//
// WHAT IT REPLACES. Two lanes of the net each grew their own copy of these three questions, and
// the pairs did not merely duplicate each other, they rested on DIFFERENT invariants — so lifting
// either one at random would have been a coin flip about which future markup change breaks the
// net. Each reconciliation below says which form won and why.

// ── The live question ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// EVERY DATE SHAPE THE FIVE FORMATS PRODUCE. The live question is stamped with the format that was
// in effect when it was GENERATED, so "which shape is on screen" is the observable that says
// whether a regeneration happened — deterministic where the date itself is random.
const DATE_SHAPES = [
  ['numeric YMD', /^-?\d+-\d+-\d+$/],

// THE REGIONS THAT ARE NOT THE GAME SCREEN, and excluding them is a correctness fix rather than an
// optimisation. The reader below insists on finding EXACTLY ONE date-shaped leaf and throws
// otherwise, which is the right strictness — a screen asking two questions at once is a real bug
// and should fail loudly rather than be read at random. But many cases run it with the ⚙ panel
// OPEN, and the panel renders a date of its own ('Last Updated: 4/27/1828 12:00'), while the
// changelog modal renders BARE numeric dates that match these shapes exactly. The stamp escapes
// only by its prefix and its time suffix — one markup change away from taking every group-10 case
// down at once for a reason unrelated to what any of them assert, and the changelog modal already
// would. So the question is asked of the game screen, by excluding the two regions the app itself
// marks out: the panel by its published id, its modals by the marker App resolves live.

// THE LIVE QUESTION, as the one date the screen is asking about, with the format it was stamped
// with. Leaf elements only, and anything holding the Deduction placeholder ('__') is skipped —
// that screen is always mounted and shows a PARTIAL date.
//
// ⚠ RECONCILED FORM: shape-aware, and over ALL elements rather than over DIVs only. The two lanes
// split here — one scanned every element for all five shapes, the other scanned DIVs for the
// numeric-ymd shape alone. The shape is load-bearing (it is how a regeneration is observed at all),
// and the DIV restriction was an accident of the markup on the day it was written: it would go
// silently blind the moment a question moved into a span or a <p>. So the wider scan wins, and
// readDate() below is expressed on top of it rather than beside it.
