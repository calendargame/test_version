// tests/helpers/pageLoad.js — A PAGE LOAD AND A REAL CLOSE, for a file that keeps the app's module
// singletons (one that mounts the statically-imported <App/>, or drives the real stores in place).
//
// WHY. The app's stores are created once, when their modules are first imported, and that IS the
// page load: each reads storage then, and never again on its own. A test file imports them once for
// its whole life, so "reload the page" and "close the app and open it again" have to be said some
// other way. (tests/helpers/persistence's reopenApp says it by importing every module afresh — the
// truest model, but the stores it returns are not the ones a mounted <App/> holds.)
//
//   loadPage() — every store reads storage again, in the order a real load evaluates them: the
//                registry (which preset), each preset's Amnesic value for the session
//                (store/sessionAmnesic — the session's own record on a reload, the saved defaults on
//                a fresh open), then the four per-preset stores and the two Lookup lists. And
//                everything a page holds only in memory is gone: the saves a full device refused
//                (store/storageHealth).
//   closeApp() — the browser ending the session: sessionStorage is emptied, which is all a close is
//                (nothing in the app detects one). The browsing-session marker goes with it, so the
//                loadPage() that follows is a fresh open.
// A RELOAD is loadPage() on its own; A REAL CLOSE is closeApp() then loadPage(). A file with the app
// mounted unmounts before either and mounts again after.
//
// ⚠ NOT WRAPPED IN act() HERE. zustand's rehydrate() returns a thenable, and an act() handed one
// goes async and leaves its queue open; a caller with the app mounted wraps the call in a BRACED
// act(() => { loadPage() }) itself (tests/amnesic.dom's note on its own relaunch says what the
// unbraced form costs).
