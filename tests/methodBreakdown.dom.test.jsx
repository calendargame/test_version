// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// The codes panel's FREEZE STATE MACHINE (components/MethodBreakdown) — Q5, round 11.
//
// MethodBreakdownSection holds the four inputs its body reads (date, format, cellDates, Julian)
// steady for CODES_CLOSE_MS after the panel starts closing, so the contents cannot change while
// it is still visibly sliding shut. The Expander wiring around that — the stated duration, the
// aria disclosure contract, the per-instance panel id — is pinned in expander.dom; what lives
// here is the machine itself, and specifically the transition the machine used to get wrong:
// the DATE GOING AWAY.
//
// A date going away is a close like any other (the panel's `open` folds in hasDate), and until
// Q5 the freeze effect opened with `if (!date) return`. That skipped the close path: React ran
// the previous run's cleanup, clearing the pending release timer, and armed nothing in its
// place, so the panel stayed flagged as closing and the frozen snapshot stayed at the date that
// had already gone away until the next open overwrote it. It was never VISIBLE, because a
// section with no date is forced closed — which is exactly why it is pinned here rather than
// left to be rediscovered: the guard is a real guarantee this file states out loud, not a
// coincidence that happened to cover for a stuck machine.
//
// Every case is driven controlled (open + onOpenChange), which is the shape all six live call
// sites use. Motion is CSS and unverifiable in jsdom; what is asserted is the machine's state,
// read through the body the frozen snapshot renders.
