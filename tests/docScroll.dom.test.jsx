// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// THE GUIDE'S SCROLLER, AS A MECHANISM — the complete inventory of HOW How to Play scrolls, and
// nothing else. Round 13 replaced that mechanism wholesale, so this file was rewritten wholesale;
// every assertion below is the REPLACEMENT for one that named the shape it superseded.
//
// WHAT CHANGED. Rounds 7-12 stamped data-doc-scroll on <html> for the whole of guide mode, which
// released the app's three scroll clamps (html/body overflow:hidden + the fixed 100dvh #root) and
// made the DOCUMENT the scroller on that one screen. It bought iOS's tap-the-status-bar-to-
// scroll-to-top, which targets the root scroller exclusively. It cost the mode selector's first
// tap while the page was coasting, on the owner's own device, twice. He established the fix
// himself by testing the app's inner scrollers, and accepted the price knowingly: the status-bar
// gesture is GONE on How to Play, permanently, and no substitute is to be built. The guide now
// scrolls #appScroll, the same container every other screen scrolls. The argument in full lives at
// `switchMode` in src/main.tsx.
//
// ★ THE FILENAME IS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED even though "doc scroll" is exactly what went away:
// tests/expander.dom points at this file by name for two of its own pins, and that file is frozen.
// Read the name as a fossil and the describes below as the truth.
//
// ★ THE BEHAVIOUR the mechanism exists to deliver is pinned in tests/guideScroll.dom, through an
// abstraction that resolves whichever scroller is live — the reading position surviving a mode
// switch and a resume, the accordion seating a tapped panel, the progressive edges. That file
// passed the move UNCHANGED, all 34 of it, which is the move's proof. Nothing from it is repeated
// here; nothing here is a substitute for it.
