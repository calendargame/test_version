// tests/containingBlockGuard.test.js — Q8 round-11's silent-dependency guard.
//
// The mode selector's dropdown panel is position:FIXED (components/CustomSelect), which is what
// makes its position scroll-independent in both the clamped modes and the guide's document scroll.
// "Fixed" means "positioned against the viewport" — but only while no ancestor has CREATED A
// CONTAINING BLOCK for fixed descendants. transform, filter, backdrop-filter, will-change, contain
// and perspective all do exactly that: put any one of them on <html>, <body> or #root and the
// panel silently starts answering to a scrolling box instead of the viewport, i.e. it drifts with
// the page again — the Round-4 report Q8 root-caused, back with no code change to blame.
//
// That is an invisible dependency, so it gets a visible test. This scans the two places those
// three elements can be styled — src/index.css and index.html (its inline <style> plus the class
// attributes on <html>/<body>/#root) — and the one way JS can add an inline style to them.
// Nothing here is about scrolling per se; it is about who the viewport is.
