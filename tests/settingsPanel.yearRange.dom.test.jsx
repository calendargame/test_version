//
// THE YEAR RANGE, AND THE FOUR OFFERS — groups 5 and 6 of the ⚙ settings behaviour net.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The Settings panel is about to be lifted out of App (src/main.tsx), and the
// gate on that move is that this net passes with ZERO edits. These two groups are the largest hole
// in the existing suite and the place a plausible simplifying rewrite is most likely to pass every
// other test while changing what the user gets:
//
//   • NOTHING IN THE REPO HAD EVER TYPED INTO THE YEAR BOXES. Verified by full-text search before
//     this file was written — the only prior references read them with getByDisplayValue. So every
//     commit, revert and clamp below is new ground.
//   • THE YEAR BOXES ARE THE STATE THE at-defaults BOOLEANS USED TO DISAGREE ABOUT. Two booleans
//     survive — "has anything changed" and "is the whole app fresh" — and both are drawn as the
//     same grey dim, so a rewrite that collapses them into one looks like a tidy-up and is a
//     behaviour change nobody can see. There were THREE when this file was written, and the third
//     was the disagreement: half-typed text counted as a change for two of the four footer offers
//     and not for the other two. Round 14 closed that (defect D1) on the owner's call, and the case
//     that pinned it now asserts the agreement instead.
//
// ★ EVERYTHING HERE PINS WHAT THE APP DOES TODAY, INCLUDING ITS QUIRKS. That is the whole point:
// the net is the proof that the move changed nothing, so a case written as the behaviour SHOULD be
// would break the gate on the very move it exists to protect. Several places below pin something
// that looks wrong; each says so and names it. Search this file for "PINS" to find every one.
// ⚠ Cases that say "RE-BLESSED (round 14)" are the deliberate exception: those pinned a defect, the
// defect was fixed on purpose in the round before the extraction, and each records what it used to
// assert and why that changed. They are the only edits this file has taken, and they were made
// BEFORE the move — so the zero-edit gate on the extraction itself is still clean.
//
// ★ WHERE THE SPEC AND THE CODE DISAGREED, THE CODE WON. Three of the spec's sentences for these
// groups describe behaviour the app does not have; each is called out at the case that corrects it
// (search "SPEC CORRECTION"). The spec is a map drawn by other readers; the app is the territory.
//
// Everything is routed through tests/helpers/settingsPanel.jsx, so no assertion here names a
// component, a parent element or a class string. The stores are driven directly ONLY where the
// value lives on a MODE SCREEN rather than in this panel (the mode prefs), which is the same route
// the existing mode tests take and is deliberately not re-exported by the panel helper.
