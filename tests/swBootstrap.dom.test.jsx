// The service-worker BOOTSTRAP in main.tsx — the two ways the app can end up with no service worker
// at all, and what it does about each.
//
// src/sw.ts's own failure modes are tests/swRegistration.dom.test.js. This file covers the half that
// lives in the auto-update-on-open effect: the dynamic import of that module, and the branch that
// runs when the browser has no Service Worker API in the first place. Both used to be untestable —
// the effect is import.meta.env.PROD-gated, so under Vitest it simply returned — and the import
// failure was pinned only by a source-text guard that read main.tsx as a string. It happened for
// real in production (a "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" on a load not yet controlled
// by a worker) while that guard sat there passing, which is what a source guard is worth.
//
// vi.stubEnv('PROD', true) opens the gate so the real production boot path runs. The module-scope
// auto-mount and the observability start in main.tsx are both #root-guarded, and #root is created
// AFTER the import here, so neither fires — this file mounts <App/> itself, exactly as the other DOM
// tests do.
