//
// THE STAT BOX'S THREE SIGNALS (C1, round 16) — the behaviour net for the redesign.
//
// The rule the whole strip is built to, site-wide, in every mode that has toggleable stats:
//
//   • an em dash (—)  = there is no data YET, but there could be
//   • BLANK           = this group is HIDDEN
//   • DIM             = nothing is being recorded — and dim only ever applies to the WHOLE STRIP,
//                       never to one cell
//
// ⚠ BLANK MEANS HIDDEN AND NOTHING MORE, and the shorthand it replaced ("you turned these off; they
// ARE still recording") was wrong twice over. Whether hiding also PAUSES is the caller's business,
// not the panel's: the scoring trio keeps recording in every mode and the timing trio keeps
// recording in Blitz/AoX (visual-only, Q8), but hiding timing in Classic/Deduction/Flash stops the
// clock outright and re-enabling after answering costs a full reset. And it is not always the
// user's own doing — Classic and Deduction SHIP with timing hidden, which is the launch case pinned
// further down. Only the first of those halves is exercised by the RECORDING case below (the
// scoring trio), so the shorthand was also unguarded where it was false.
//
// and the full table those three produce:
//
//   group on, no data ....... the values, which read '—'      plain
//   group on, has data ...... the values                      plain
//   group OFF ............... value cells BLANK, labels stay  plain
//   Save Stats off .......... '—' in every value cell         whole strip dimmed
//   group off + Save off .... value cells BLANK               whole strip dimmed
//
// WHAT IT REPLACED, AND THE REAL BUG UNDERNEATH IT. One flag used to carry two facts:
// modeHooks derived `sOff = scoringOff || !saveStats`, and that single bit drove BOTH a label
// strikethrough and an em dash. So turning Save Stats off struck through and dashed EVERY box, and
// your own per-group choices vanished underneath the global state — not lost (scoringOff/timingOff
// persist and come back) but invisible, so you could not predict what a tap would do. Separately, a
// SHOWN stat with nothing recorded yet also read as a dash, so "I hid this" and "nothing here yet"
// were the same picture. The two facts are now two flags — `off` (yours, per group) and `dimmed`
// (the app's, whole strip) — and the strikethrough is gone entirely.
//
// The file has two halves. The first drives <StatPanel> directly, because the table above is a
// statement about the COMPONENT and every mode inherits whatever it does. The second drives the
// real <App/> through Classic, because the bug was in the shared hook's derivation and only a real
// screen with a real Save Stats switch can prove the two flags no longer collapse into one.
