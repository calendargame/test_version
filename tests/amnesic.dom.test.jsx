// amnesic.dom — A PRESET THAT NEVER WRITES ITS STATS DOWN.
//
// ★★ THE ONE CLAIM THIS FILE EXISTS TO PROVE, and it is deliberately expressible in one sentence:
// WHILE A PRESET IS AMNESIC, NOTHING WRITES ITS PERMANENT STATS. Everything else here — the zero
// start, the discard on the way back, the guest handing the phone over — is a consequence of that
// sentence, and every case that asserts it does so as a BYTE COMPARISON of the payload on disk
// rather than field by field. A field-by-field check would pass a re-serialisation that quietly
// rewrote something the case did not think to look at, which is exactly the failure mode: the bug
// this feature could have shipped is not "the numbers are wrong", it is "the numbers were replaced
// by a session's".
//
// ⚠ WHY A MOUNTED APP IS PART OF THE GATE. The store-level cases below can prove where bytes go;
// they cannot prove the thing that has already cost this app once. The five mode screens are ALWAYS
// MOUNTED, hydrate their stats ONCE at mount and mirror them back on every change, so repointing
// storage underneath them without a remount leaves the stores right and the screens a copy behind —
// and the very next answered question writes the copy behind over the copy that is live. It was
// reproduced against the real stores: a device with 500 cards ended up holding 4. Turning Amnesic
// on repoints exactly that storage, so nothing short of a mounted app, a toggle, and an answered
// question can catch the regression. ★ IF SOMEONE DELETES src/main.tsx's registry subscription, or
// narrows it back from store/amnesic's activeDataId to activeId alone, "the session starts at zero
// on screen" is the case that goes red — and nothing else in the suite would.
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE MAY COMPOSE A STORAGE KEY, on tests/presetSwitch.dom's precedent and for the same
// kind of reason: it has to read the SAME preset's two copies — the parked permanent one and the
// session one — at the same moment, and tests/helpers/persistence's observation-based resolver can
// only ever answer for wherever the store is pointed right now. It composes them by CALLING the
// real presetKey, so it pins nothing about spelling; that is tests/presets.dom's job.

// COLD-OPEN RESEED (round 21). An Amnesic flag is a SESSION toggle: every genuine app open resets
// EVERY preset's Amnesic flag to that preset's own saved default (store/userDefaults'
// effectiveAmnesicDefault — false when nothing is saved). A mid-session toggle still sticks until
// the next cold open. src/main.tsx does this in a one-shot boot effect that walks the registry and
// reads each preset's namespaced userDefaults key through storedAmnesicDefault.
//
// ⚠ THE SIMULATION. relaunch() elsewhere in this file is a store rehydrate — a RELOAD, which keeps
// the session. A cold open is the browser ENDING the session and a fresh <App/> mount, so coldOpen()
// below unmounts, clears sessionStorage (what a real close does — it is also what takes the session
// stats and store/browsingSession's marker with it), and mounts again: the store singletons and
// localStorage carry over (a real browser reloads them from disk to the same values), and it is the
// boot effect on the fresh mount that does the reseed. ★ Round 23: a remount WITHOUT the clear is a
// reload, and a reload no longer reseeds — pinned by the last case in this block.
