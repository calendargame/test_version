// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// amnesic.dom — A PRESET THAT DOES NOT WRITE ITS STATS DOWN, in its two kinds.
//
// ★★ THE CLAIMS THIS FILE EXISTS TO PROVE, and each is deliberately expressible in one sentence:
//   FULL        — WHILE A PRESET IS ON FULL, NOTHING WRITES ITS PERMANENT COPY. Not a byte.
//   STATS ONLY  — WHILE A PRESET IS ON STATS ONLY, THE ONLY THING WRITTEN TO ITS PERMANENT COPY IS A
//                 BEST. Its stats do not move by a byte, and a Best set in the session is there for
//                 good the moment it is set.
// Everything else here — the zero start, the discard on every change, the guest handing the phone
// over — is a consequence of those two sentences, and every case that asserts them does so as a BYTE
// COMPARISON of what is on disk rather than field by field. A field-by-field check would pass a
// re-serialisation that quietly rewrote something the case did not think to look at, which is exactly
// the failure mode: the bug this feature could have shipped is not "the numbers are wrong", it is
// "the numbers were replaced by a session's".
//
// ⚠ WHY A MOUNTED APP IS PART OF THE GATE. The store-level cases below can prove where bytes go;
// they cannot prove the thing that has already cost this app once. The five mode screens are ALWAYS
// MOUNTED, hydrate their stats ONCE at mount and mirror them back on every change, so repointing
// storage underneath them without a remount leaves the stores right and the screens a copy behind —
// and the very next answered question writes the copy behind over the copy that is live. It was
// reproduced against the real stores: a device with 500 cards ended up holding 4. Changing the
// Amnesic value repoints exactly that storage, so nothing short of a mounted app, a change, and an
// answered question can catch the regression. ★ IF SOMEONE DELETES src/main.tsx's subscription to
// the session's Amnesic values, or narrows it back from store/amnesic's activeDataId to activeId
// alone, "the session starts at zero on screen" is the case that goes red — and nothing else in the
// suite would.
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE MAY COMPOSE A STORAGE KEY, on tests/presetSwitch.dom's precedent and for the same
// kind of reason: it has to read the SAME preset's two copies — the parked permanent one and the
// session one — at the same moment, and tests/helpers/persistence's observation-based resolver can
// only ever answer for wherever the store is pointed right now. It composes them by CALLING the
// real presetKey, so it pins nothing about spelling; that is tests/presets.dom's job.
//
// What a parked ROUND does across a change is tests/amnesicRound.dom's; where each preset's value
// comes from when a page loads (a reload, a real close, an older build, another tab, a full device)
// is tests/sessionAmnesic.dom's.
