// tests/changelogStamp.test.js — the deploy stamp and the changelog date, pinned (round 16, Q1).
//
// THE CLASS: two facts about one deploy kept in step by memory. Q1 half 1 took the stamp out of
// human hands (vite.config.js injects the build clock as __BUILD_TS__), which on its own would have
// left the changelog date as a chore nobody was prompted for any more. Half 2 is the guard —
// scripts/changelogStamp.mjs, wired as a build-FAILING vite plugin — that makes the newest entry's
// PACIFIC date and the stamp's Pacific date the same thing or no build at all.
//
// WHAT IS PINNED HERE is the comparison, not the wiring, on the precacheIntegrity precedent: the
// plugin is four lines of glue, while everything that can be subtly wrong lives in the conversion.
// The stamp is a UTC instant and the entry date is a Pacific calendar day, so the two disagree for
// the 7–8 hours between Pacific midnight and UTC midnight — every case below that names a time is
// standing in that window on purpose. Both offsets are exercised (PDT is UTC-7, PST is UTC-8), on
// both sides of both midnights, across both 2026 switchovers and across a year boundary, because a
// hand-written offset would pass half of these and fail the other half.
//
// ⚠ NOTHING HERE READS THE CLOCK. A case that compared the real changelog against `new Date()`
// would go red on the first day nobody deployed, which would make the suite a calendar rather than
// a test. The real CHANGELOG is checked against instants DERIVED from its own newest entry instead,
// which is day-drift-free and still proves the shipped data satisfies the guard that gates it.

// tests/settingsPanel.lifecycle.dom asserts only its rendered SHAPE — both of which a live clock
// satisfies exactly as well as the epoch does. So if `command` were ever resolved as 'build' under
// Vitest, or that ternary were edited, every stamp-touching case in the suite would quietly become
