// sessionAmnesic.olderBuilds — WHAT THE OLDER BUILDS ON THIS ORIGIN MAKE OF THE AMNESIC SETTING AS THIS
// BUILD SAVES IT, AND WHAT THIS BUILD MAKES OF WHAT THEY LEAVE.
//
// Live and staging share one browser origin, so v2.27.3 and v2.26.0 read and write the same saved
// defaults and the same preset registry this build does. To them Amnesic is a boolean: a switch kept
// on each preset in the registry, put back to `saved.amnesic` at a fresh open. This build made the
// setting three-way and moved the value in force into the browsing session — and every claim it
// makes about staying safe beside those builds rests on what THEY do.
// ★ THAT WAS RUN, NOT READ. tests/fixtures/olderBuilds/amnesic-v2.27.3.json and amnesic-v2.26.0.json
// are what the real app at each tag (fcdcf56, ff506f8) did when amnesicDrive.dom.test.jsx.txt drove
// it over storage in this build's shapes: where one answered question went, what its registry and
// its saved defaults held afterwards. This file holds this build's reader, and its decisions, to
// those records.
