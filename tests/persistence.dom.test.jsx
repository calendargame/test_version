//
// THE PERSISTENCE BEHAVIOUR NET — what the app promises to REMEMBER, pinned before settings presets
// move where any of it is kept.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Presets turn one saved copy of the app's data into several independent ones, which
// is a change to WHERE every store reads and writes. Rule 10 says a restructure of live logic goes
// behind tests written FIRST against the current app as a black box, and the gate on this one is
// falsifiable: THE NET PASSES THE CHANGE WITH ZERO EDITS TO ANY CASE. Rounds 13 and 14 established
// that the only way to earn that is an indirection — the net asks a helper "where does this store
// read and write" and never answers for itself. That helper is tests/helpers/persistence.js, and it
// works the answer out by OBSERVATION rather than by holding a copy of the key constants, which is
// what makes it survive whatever namespacing scheme the preset work picks.
//
// ⚠ NOT ONE CASE IN THIS FILE NAMES A localStorage KEY. That is the rule, not a style preference:
// the key is the implementation detail about to change, and a case pinning it would break on the
// change while teaching the next reader that the key IS the contract. The contract is the player's:
// what you saved is there when you come back, an older save still opens, storage that refuses does
// not cost you the app, and each of the three resets clears exactly what it says and nothing else.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. The build stamp, the two update-dot flags, the changelog
// seen-signature and the two sessionStorage flags are all persisted, and none of them is a player's
// PER-PRESET saved data — they describe the CODE THAT RAN or this device's current session. They
// stay GLOBAL across presets (a preset switch must not make the update dot reappear), so they are
// not the subject of this net; tests/buildStamp.dom and tests/changelog.dom already own them and
// must keep passing unchanged through the preset work, which is itself the assertion that they
// stayed global.
//
// ⚠ LOOKUP HISTORY JOINED THAT LIST (round 20). It used to live inside `progress`, one of the
// four stores this net exists to prove ARE independent per-preset places — but it is a player's
// saved data that is nonetheless GLOBAL, the one exception the file header on store/lookupHistory
// argues for at length: a Lookup is a question you asked, not a record of how you did, so it reads
// the same whichever preset is open. It moved to its own store/lookupHistory.ts and its own test
// file, tests/lookupHistory.dom, which owns proving it survives a reopen, a preset switch and a
// preset delete — but NOT a Full Reset, which still clears it (the owner's explicit call: there is
// only one shared copy, and pressing Full Reset from any preset removes the only one there is). That
// is the identical shape of proof this file gives the four stores below, just for a store that is
// not one of them any more.
