// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// THE ⚙ SETTINGS PANEL — ITS LIFECYCLE, groups 1, 10 and 13 of the behaviour net.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The panel is about to be lifted out of the 2,287-line App in
// src/main.tsx. That is a REWRITE, not a move — the panel closes over a great deal of App state —
// so the gate on it is falsifiable and absolute: THIS FILE PASSES WITH ZERO EDITS on the far side.
// Every question below is the user's ("open the panel", "did the question change", "did the press
// land"), routed through tests/helpers/settingsPanel.jsx so that not one of them names a
// component, a parent element or a Tailwind token.
//
// THE THREE GROUPS ARE ONE STORY, which is why they share a file:
//   • GROUP 1 — the panel opens and closes by every route. Eight distinct close routes, each of
//     which must produce the IDENTICAL open→close transition.
//   • GROUP 10 — that transition is what COMMITS deferred settings work, through all six
//     useSettingsCloseEffect callers. This is risk R1, the deepest silent-failure risk in the
//     extraction: a panel that hosts a useSettingsCloseEffect call and unmounts on close never
//     produces a true→false transition, so every apply-on-close stops firing and NOTHING THROWS.
//     Every existing deferral test pokes the store with useSettings.getState().setX(...) and then
//     toggles the panel; not one clicks a real control. Every case here clicks a real control.
//   • GROUP 13 — the DOM markers that carry that behaviour. They are not closures: a global
//     pointer controller and three App-level listeners resolve them LIVE, so renaming or
//     re-parenting one changes what the user gets with no code change near any handler (risk R10).
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE PINS, INCLUDING ITS QUIRKS. The net's job is to freeze what the app does TODAY
// so the extraction is provably faithful. Where a case below looks wrong, it is pinned deliberately
// and says so; the fix is a separate change made AFTER the net is green.
//
// ⚠ ONE ENVIRONMENT ARTEFACT THE CASES HAVE TO RESPECT, and it now lives where the next builder
// will meet it rather than only here: the full account is at pressDragFromGear in
// tests/helpers/settingsPanel.jsx. In short — the press-drag controller ALWAYS suppresses the
// trigger's own click, jsdom never delivers that click, so after a synthetic press-drag the arming
// is still live and the NEXT click on the gear is swallowed. A case that press-drags therefore
// never re-opens (or closes) the panel with a gear tap: it stands the app up again, or travels a
// route that is not a click.
