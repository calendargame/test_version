// ── The fixed portal panel: position, what closes it, and --bar-h ────────────────────────────
//
// POSITION (round 11). The option panel portals into #root as position:FIXED, so its
// containing block is the viewport in both of the app's layouts and its coordinates are simply
// the trigger's viewport rect — no scroll term, no mode-dependent correction. That replaces the
// round-4 ± window.scrollY patch, which existed only because the panel was position:absolute
// while guide mode (html[data-doc-scroll]) MADE #root static, moving the panel's containing block
// to the document origin. Both halves of that are history now — round 13 deleted the document
// scroller, so #root is fixed in every mode — and the assertion here is deliberately STRONGER than
// either: the old test pinned a particular scroll term, this one pins that the panel's position
// does not depend on any scroll AT ALL.
// The auto-flip-up branch is gone with it (owner's call): at the only call site the trigger is
// inside the bar the flip measured its ceiling from, so the space above is structurally negative
// and the branch was unreachable. Its three tests are gone for the same reason — testing an
// unreachable branch is how it survives.
//
// ⚠ WHAT CLOSES IT (rewritten 2026-08-07, and the direction REVERSED — read this before
// "fixing" anything below). A SCROLL DOES NOT CLOSE THIS MENU. Choosing an option closes it, a
// press outside it closes it, Escape/Tab close it, Android Back closes it. A document scroll does
// nothing whatsoever, and that is the OWNER'S EXPLICIT DECISION (2026-08-07), not an oversight.
//
// It was a dismiss rule for three rounds, and the rule needed to tell "a scroll you started with
// the menu open" (dismiss) from "a scroll that was already gliding when you opened it" (leave
// alone). Drawing that line means timing scroll events, and two mechanisms — a `scrollend`
// boundary, then a measured gap between scroll events — each PASSED IN CHROMIUM and each FAILED on
// the owner's iPhone. The half that made the whole thing impossible was never a timing bug: WebKit
// deliberately suppresses the entire touch sequence of a tap that interrupts momentum deceleration
// (no touchstart, no pointerdown, no click — since ~2017, with no `touch-action` opt-out), so a tap
// on a coasting page cannot open this menu under ANY design. Given a rule that could only ever be
// approximated, the owner chose to drop it: the menu now behaves like a native iOS menu, and
// because its trigger is in the FIXED top bar the panel simply rides along, still glued under the
// button it belongs to, while the page moves.
// The owner's cases, as they now stand:
//   A. tap the trigger while the page still coasts → the platform eats that tap; the first tap
//      stops the page and the second opens the menu. Nothing to test in jsdom: the event never
//      reaches the app. (What IS testable and IS fixed: once open, it stays open — below.)
//   B. the page is already gliding when it opens   → opens, and the glide neither closes nor moves
//      it;
//   C. page still, the user swipes it              → closes, via the press-outside path (the
//      test says so and proves which path did it);
//   D. page still, then a scroll STARTS            → DELIBERATELY GIVEN UP. It stays open. Pinned
//      below so nobody restores the dismissal by reflex.
// No clock, no scroll cadences, no end-of-scroll signal: with nothing timing-dependent left, a
// scroll event is just an event that must have no effect, whatever its target.
