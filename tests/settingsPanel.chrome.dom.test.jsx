// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// THE SETTINGS PANEL'S CHROME — groups 11 and 12 of the Q1 behaviour net (_settings_net_spec.md).
//
// This file is written against the CURRENT app, BEFORE the Settings panel is extracted out of
// App, so that the same text stays true on both sides of the move. That is the whole point: the
// falsifiable gate for the extraction is "this net passes with ZERO edits". Everything here is
// therefore routed through tests/helpers/settingsPanel.jsx and asserts what a user can SEE — a
// label, an offer, a mask, a shadow — never where in the tree the markup happens to live today.
//
// GROUP 11 — Check for updates. One variable drives four surfaces: the label (which IS the state),
// whether the control is operable, whether it wears the underline, and an abort-on-close effect.
// The abort is the only thing standing between a dismissed panel and a full-screen Updating
// overlay appearing afterwards, so that is the case that matters most here.
//
// GROUP 12 — panel geometry and the sticky footer, EXPRESSED AS BEHAVIOUR. jsdom has no layout
// engine, so a case that measures is a case that lies. What is real here is STRUCTURE: the footer
// is inside the card and outside the scroller, so it cannot scroll away. The edge indicators ARE
// fully drivable, because the edge hook reads three numbers off the scroller and jsdom lets us
// define all three.
//
// ⚠ WHERE THE LAYOUT CLASS PINS WENT, and why they are not here. This case used to also assert the
// card's raw Tailwind tokens — flex, flex-col, the max-h-[calc(100dvh…)] cap, min-h-0 on the
// scroller. Those tokens are load-bearing (lose min-h-0 and the flex child refuses to shrink, so
// the list never scrolls and the footer leaves the screen, with a fully green suite) but they are
// exactly the implementation detail this net forbids, and they are the assertions most likely to
// force an EDIT on the far side of the extraction — which would break the zero-edit gate they were
// meant to serve. Componentising the card, or moving the cap into index.css where the bar-height
// variable already lives, changes nothing a user meets and fails five of them. They now live in
// the PIXEL GATES describe at the foot of tests/settings.dom, which is the block this repo already
// declares as deliberately implementation-coupled and exempt from the abstraction. Nothing was
// dropped; it moved to the file that owns that kind of claim.
//
// NOT COVERED HERE, deliberately, and on the device checklist instead:
//   • G12.5 — the three footer captions sharing one font size and never falling below the 11px
//     floor. fitFooterBtns measures widths, every width in jsdom is 0, and the fit is a no-op.
//     Nothing below implies otherwise.
//   • G11.7's "…including when the build change is detected while the panel is ALREADY open".
//     The detection effect runs at mount and the panel mounts closed, so that ordering is
//     unreachable from a test; the [settingsOpen, gearDot] dep that covers it is a code-review
//     item. What IS swept below is the half that is reachable: every open route retires the dot.
