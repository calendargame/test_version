// DOM test harness setup (Stage C, Step 6 — the mode-untangle safety net, sub-step 0).
//
// Referenced by vite.config.js `test.setupFiles`, so it runs before EVERY test file is
// imported, in that file's environment. It does two things:
//
//   1. Registers @testing-library/jest-dom matchers on Vitest's `expect`
//      (toBeInTheDocument, toHaveTextContent, etc.). Harmless under Node.
//
//   2. Installs the handful of browser APIs jsdom omits but the app touches at MODULE
//      LOAD or first render — so a jsdom test can import the real app without crashing:
//        - matchMedia       — read at module scope (isTouch) AND in the theme effect, i.e.
//                             BEFORE any component mounts; must exist the moment main.jsx
//                             is imported (a setupFile guarantees that ordering).
//        - ResizeObserver   — three layout effects construct one (bar-height + two
//                             scroll-state observers).
//        - requestAnimationFrame / cancelAnimationFrame — the timer rAF loop + flash bar.
//        - scrollTo         — BFCache scroll-reset effect + Full Reset.
//        - offsetParent     — the one layout fact the app's KEYBOARD handler asks (see below).
//
// Every other stub is INERT (no-op writes, false/empty reads). Characterization tests assert on
// game logic and rendered output, never on real layout geometry, so faithful measurement
// isn't needed — only that these calls don't throw. All stubs are window-guarded so this
// file is a no-op (beyond the matchers) under the Node-environment pure-logic tests.

  // `offsetParent !== null` — every mode screen stays mounted, hidden with display:none, so each
  // key has five buttons and one of them showing. jsdom does no layout: offsetParent is null for
  // EVERY element, so the handler skipped every button and no game key did anything in any test.
  // A key test could only ever prove a press was ignored, and it "proved" that of every key.
  // So the harness gives offsetParent the one rule the app relies on, for every DOM test: null for
  // an element that is not in the document or sits inside a display:none subtree (inline — the
  // suite loads no stylesheet, and the mode screens hide themselves inline — or the `hidden`
  // attribute), its parent element otherwise. It is not the browser's real positioned ancestor,
  // and nothing in the app asks for that: both readers only compare it with null.

// Saved progress (Stage D1) is a module singleton the app reads, so — like the settings store —

  // namespaced keys: a file that switched presets in one test left `cg-settings-v1~p2` behind for the
  // next, written by this very net a moment after the file's own localStorage.clear(). Nothing in the
  // app reads that key afterwards — but store/presetControl's createPreset does (its skip loop refuses
  // an id whose keys already exist), so the next test's "createPreset then switch to preset 2" got
  // preset 3 and switched to a preset that did not exist. Found by a shuffled run (round 22's fixer).

  // It is the widest leak of the lot, because almost nothing reads the snapshot directly: what reads
  // it is the word "default" everywhere else — the gear indicator, both footer dims, Full Reset's
  // own dim, every mode screen's freshness report — so the symptom is never "a default is wrong", it
  // is a button in the wrong state three files away. A file that wants a snapshot saves it in its
