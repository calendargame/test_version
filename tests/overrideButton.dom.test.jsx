// overrideButton.dom — THE DOUBLE-TAP GUARD on the Override ⇄ Undo button (components/
// OverrideButton), round 22's fixer.
//
// ★ WHY IT HAS A FILE OF ITS OWN rather than a case inside one mode's suite: the button is ONE
// shared component used by all five modes, and the guard is about the INPUT that reaches it, not
// about anything a mode does with the press. Classic is the fixture here purely because it is the
// launch screen and its Override path is one answer away — the claim is the button's, in every mode.
//
// ⚠⚠ WHAT MAKES THESE CASES MEAN ANYTHING: they press with a REAL POINTER GESTURE — a pointerdown
// followed by a click carrying a click count — because that is exactly the input the guard is scoped
// to. Every other test in this suite clicks programmatically (no pointerdown, `detail` 0), which the
// guard deliberately lets through: the keyboard and assistive routes have never had the accidental
// double-press problem (App drops key repeats outright), and adding a delay to them would be adding
// a fault. So the two halves are asserted here side by side rather than left to be inferred.

// strict "inside the window"), so these cases also pin the boundary: widen the constant in
// components/OverrideButton without widening this one and they fail.
