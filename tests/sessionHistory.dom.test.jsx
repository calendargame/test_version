// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// sessionHistory.dom — Classic / Deduction / Flash's back/forward history is kept for the BROWSING
// SESSION (the owner: "only truly closing the app starts fresh"): a reload keeps it, a preset switch
// keeps each preset's own, and a guest's Amnesic interlude hands yours back when it ends. A real
// close, Reset Stats, Full Reset and a preset delete clear it — and nothing brings cleared data back.
// An in-progress Blitz round is still cleared by a reload (the owner's explicit choice).
//
// And THE LIVE-QUESTION RULE, which holds for all three ways back: the question that was waiting is
// regenerated only when a time could still be recorded for it — timing is shown in that mode at the
// moment it comes back, and the question is unanswered with no wrong answer, Reveal or Show Codes.
// Otherwise the same question returns, including on a screen with no history.
//
// The store and the engine halves have their own files (tests/sessionHistory,
// tests/engine/parkedHistory); this one proves the WIRING, on the mounted app, because a green store
// suite with the screens never calling it would be exactly the round-21 Group D failure.
//
// ★ HOW A RELOAD IS MODELLED. A real reload fires `pagehide` and then the page simply stops: React
// runs NO cleanup. So reloadApp() fires pagehide, keeps sessionStorage exactly as the page left it,
// tears the tree down, puts sessionStorage back as it was at pagehide (undoing anything a cleanup the
// real page never runs just did), and mounts again. The stores are module singletons that already
// hold what localStorage holds, which is what a real reload's hydration would read back. closeApp()
// is the other door: sessionStorage gone, the browsing session forgotten — the browser's own doing on
// a real close.
