//
// ⚙ SETTINGS — THE PICKERS: every lock and its exact condition, the theme block's SHAPE change,
// and the Use-System round trip. Groups 2, 3 and 4 of the behaviour net (_settings_net_spec.md).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The panel is about to be lifted out of App, and the gate on that move is
// that this net passes with ZERO edits. So every question below is the user's — "is this picker
// offered", "which pill is lit", "what theme is on screen", "is the gear reporting modified" —
// asked through tests/helpers/settingsPanel. Nothing here names a DOM position, a parent element,
// a Tailwind token or a component. A test that has to be fixed on the far side of the move proves
// only that somebody made it green again.
//
// WHAT THE THREE GROUPS ARE ABOUT, and they are three genuinely different shapes:
//
//   • GROUP 2 — FOUR LOCKS, FOUR CONDITIONS. One `disabled` on the PillGroup publishes five
//     consequences at once (the dim, the group's aria-disabled, every segment's, the onChange
//     guard, and the tab stop), so they are asserted TOGETHER — a picker locked four ways out of
//     five is a real bug that a single-facet assertion cannot see. What was missing before this
//     file was the BOUNDARIES and the NEGATIVE modes: `mode==='deduction'` is the only lock driver
//     that is neither a store value nor derived from one, and five of the six modes that leave
//     Input LIVE had never been exercised.
//
//   • GROUP 3 — THE THEME BLOCK IS A SHAPE CHANGE, NOT A LOCK. Three nested PillGroups, and NONE
//     of them ever takes `disabled`. It LOOKS like a lock and is not: Use System Settings moves
//     which wrapper is NAMED (hence which one is the radiogroup) and which value each row reads
//     and writes, and nothing else. The natural "improvement" — dimming or hiding the row that
//     does not hold the pick — is a behaviour change the owner explicitly rejected, which is why
//     "neither row is EVER drawn as unavailable" is asserted in both states with a locked picker
//     alongside it as the control.
//
//   • GROUP 4 — THE USE-SYSTEM ROUND TRIP, which is one contract in two halves. The OFF flip seeds
//     the manual theme from what is ALREADY on screen, so the look never jumps; and "modified" is
//     judged only over the theme values IN EFFECT, so the round trip cannot permanently light the
//     gear. Both halves have to hold together — comparing the dormant value instead is a bug that
//     shipped once, and the accepted cost of the fix (a dormant divergence the panel offers no way
//     to reach) is pinned here deliberately so a future rewrite cannot quietly "fix" it back.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM. jsdom has no layout engine, so "the panel's height
// does not change when Use System is flipped" is a DEVICE CHECK — what is asserted here is the row
// count and the pills, which is the structural half of that promise and all of it that is
// reachable. Nothing below implies the pixel half is covered.
//
// ── WHY GROUPS 3 AND 4 ARE SHORTER THAN THE SPEC'S CASE LIST (dedup pass, round 14) ───────────
// Eleven cases that were written here first turned out to RESTATE cases tests/settings.dom already
// carried, and — this is the part that made them removable rather than merely redundant — those
// existing versions had themselves been rewritten onto tests/helpers/settingsPanel earlier in this
// round, so they survive the extraction with zero edits exactly as these did. Keeping both bought
// nothing but suite runtime. Each pair was read in full and the STRONGER one kept; in all eleven
// that was settings.dom's, because those assert the STORE value alongside what the panel shows and
// several assert an intermediate state this file skipped (see settings.dom ~155, ~182, ~204, ~245,
// ~256, ~269, ~294, ~448, ~501, ~692, ~741).
//
// WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY NOT REMOVED, because it is not a restatement — the near-misses are worth
// naming so nobody "finishes the job" later: G2.3 is the only case anywhere that asserts the Date
// Format captions are NOT dimmed while the picker is live (settings.dom asserts only the locked
// half, so a permanently-dimmed caption would pass it); G2.7 is the only case that touches the
// 1581/1582/1583 boundary the Julian Chance lock turns on (settings.dom uses 1900 and 1, which a
// `>` -for- `>=` slip clears); and G2.9 sweeps all four lockable pickers and asserts the arrow is
// preventDefault-ed, where settings.dom asks one picker and asserts only that it never reaches the
// window.
