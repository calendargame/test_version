//
// THE GUIDE'S ACCESSIBILITY SECTION, PINNED TO THE FACTS IT CLAIMS (B4).
//
// ★ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, and it is not "coverage". Every other claim the How-to-Play guide
// makes describes behaviour the suite already drives, so a change that falsified one would go red
// somewhere. The Accessibility section is different in one specific way: four of its sentences
// describe things the app DOES NOT DO — no focus ring, no pinch-zoom, unnamed history buttons and
// mode-screen sliders, and a game loop that withholds a button by dimming it without saying so
// (the ⚙ footer and Show Codes being the two places that do say so). Fixing any of those is a
// strict improvement that no existing test would notice, and the instant it lands the guide is
// lying to a reader who came to it precisely to find out what is supported. That asymmetry is the
// whole reason for the file: an ordinary regression test fails when the app gets WORSE, and these
// cases fail when it gets BETTER, so the sentence gets corrected in the same change that earns it.
//
// ★ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. The section's POSITIVE claims — the six named picker groups,
// the four named switches, both named Year Range boxes, the four modal focus traps, the accordions'
// aria-expanded/aria-controls — are already pinned, by name, in tests/settings.dom, the
// settingsPanel behaviour net and tests/expander.dom. Restating them here would be a second copy of
// a contract that already has an owner, and the round-14 lesson about a shared fact stated twice
// applies to tests as much as to code. This file adds only what nothing else can see.
//
// ★ HOW TO USE A FAILURE HERE. Do not delete the case. Each one names the guide sentence it
// protects; when it goes red, the app has changed and the sentence in
// src/components/GuidePage.tsx is now false. Rewrite the sentence, then re-bless the case to
// describe the new truth — or, if the gap is closed outright, delete the sentence and the case
// together, in one commit.
