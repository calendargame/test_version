// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// presetSwitcher.dom — THE PRESET SWITCHER CONTROL (components/PresetSwitcher).
//
// ★ WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, and what it deliberately leaves to its neighbours. It covers the control
// ITSELF: that it reads the registry, that picking an option is a real switch, and that the two
// things this control does differently from the mode selector are actually there — what it says of
// an amnesic preset, and the name cell that does not size itself to its longest option. It does NOT re-test CustomSelect's popover behaviour
// (tests/customselect owns that) and it does NOT re-test what a switch does to saved data
// (tests/presets.dom and tests/presetSwitch.dom own that, the second one with a real <App/>
// mounted, which is the only place the remount hazard is visible at all).
//
// ⚠⚠ WHAT NO CASE IN HERE CAN PROVE — SAY IT OUT LOUD RATHER THAN IMPLY OTHERWISE. jsdom has no
// layout engine: it does not lay out flex boxes, it does not resolve `em`, it does not truncate
// text and it cannot report a width. So every geometric claim this control makes — that the trigger
// fits the space the wordmark vacates, that a long name truncates with an ellipsis instead of
// pushing the bar wider — is UNVERIFIED HERE and can only be confirmed on the owner's iPhone. What these cases pin is the STRUCTURE those results depend
// on: that every option's name cell carries the same fixed width, that the width is the exported
// constant rather than a literal somebody can drift, and that the name (not the cell) carries
// `truncate`. If a future edit breaks the geometry it will
// almost certainly break one of those first, which is the most a jsdom suite can honestly offer.
