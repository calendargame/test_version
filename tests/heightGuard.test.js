// tests/heightGuard.test.js — no hard-coded PIXEL HEIGHTS in the UI tree (Q2).
// Why this is a build-failing rule and not a style preference: this app sizes itself with ONE
// fluid root font (index.css: html{font-size:clamp(…,1.95vh,…)}), so every rem-based height —
// padding, line boxes, panels, the whole vertical rhythm — shrinks together to fit a short screen
// and grows on a tall one. A height written in px is the one measurement that cannot take part in
// that. It is right on exactly one device and wrong on every other, and the failure is silent: the
// layout just runs off the bottom, or leaves a band of unused screen.
// The shipped example was the Lookup history list's max-h-[440px], which round-7 RESTORED after a
// Tailwind glue bug had silently killed it (see tests/classGlueGuard.test.js). 440px was tuned on
// one phone; on a smaller one the list pushed the Show Codes panel off-screen and the whole page
// scrolled. Round-8 Q2 replaced the cap itself with measured flex layout — the list simply takes
// the room that's left — and this guard keeps the shortcut from coming back.
// SCOPE — the VERTICAL axis only, and only fixed px:
//   • banned:  h-[64px]  min-h-[40px]  max-h-[440px]
//   • legal:   min-w-[125px], pt-[3px], text-[11px]  (widths, offsets, type — not heights)
//   • legal:   max-h-[55vh], max-h-[calc(100dvh_-_var(--bar-h))], min-h-10, h-full
//     (viewport/relative units and the rem-based scale all follow the screen; that's the point)
// A hairline BORDER or a 1px nudge is not a height and is not the target here; if a genuine
// exception ever appears, it belongs in this comment with its reason, not in a silent bypass.
