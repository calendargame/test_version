// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// topBar.dom — THE FIXED TOP BAR after the rebuild that removed the "Calendar Game" wordmark and
// put the preset switcher in its place (logo far left, preset, mode, ⚙ far right).
//
// ★ WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. Three things, and they are three because each one is a different KIND
// of claim:
//   1. THE NAME. The wordmark is gone from the screen, and the accessible name it was carrying is
//      not — an sr-only <h1> inside a <header>/banner landmark. This is the half of the change that
//      could go wrong invisibly: delete the heading and the app is unlabelled to assistive
//      technology; keep it visible and the owner's real-estate complaint is unaddressed. So both
//      halves are asserted together, and the file will not let one pass without the other.
//   2. THE ORDER. Logo, preset, mode, gear — the owner's layout, in the DOM order a screen reader
//      and a tab sequence follow, which here is also the painted order (one flex row, no `order`
//      utilities anywhere in the bar; if one is ever added this file's claim needs revisiting).
//   3. THE ⚙ EXCLUSION. Pressing the preset trigger while the ⚙ panel is open must open the menu
//      rather than slam the panel shut under the finger — the same rule the mode selector has had
//      since round 5, now owed to a second control. It is wired by a required `wrapperRef` prop
//      (components/PresetSwitcher) into App's click-outside handler, and this is the behaviour that
//      proves the wiring rather than restating it.
//
// ⚠⚠ WHAT NO CASE IN HERE CAN PROVE, said plainly. jsdom has NO LAYOUT ENGINE: it lays out no flex
// box, resolves no `em`, and reports no width. So nothing below is evidence that the four controls
// FIT — and "fits" is the actual defect this rebuild was fixing (the shipped bar overflowed its
// line by ~12.9px at 360px, spilling the mode selector to ~2.7px from the screen edge against a
// ~15.6px gutter on the left). What the fit rests on is a measurement taken OUTSIDE this suite, in
// a real layout engine, and recorded at the budget block in src/main.tsx. The last case here is a
// PROXY for it: it pins the two width cuts that budget spends, because a future edit that quietly
// restores either one would put the overflow back and no test in this repo could see it.
// ⚠ AND THE MEASUREMENT ITSELF WAS DESKTOP CHROMIUM, NOT AN IPHONE. Glyph advances and the system
// UI font differ there; only the owner's device can confirm the real thing.
