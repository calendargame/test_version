// progressStorage.fuzz — ONE DEVICE, FOUR BUILDS, RANDOM INTERLEAVINGS, AGAINST A MODEL.
//
// Live and staging are one browser origin, so the saved progress is read and written by whatever is
// open: two pages of this build line (each either this release, which never starts sealing, or the
// next, which does), a v2.27.3 page and a v2.26.0 page (tests/helpers/progressWorld's models, held
// to the real builds by tests/progressStorage.olderBuilds). Each step one of them does one thing —
// loads, answers (timed, untimed, wrong, a long run), Overrides near the end or deep in the history,
// resets a mode, Full Resets, deletes or switches preset, turns Amnesic on or off, reloads, dies
// after the k-th write of a save — while the device is sometimes full.
//
// ★ THE ORACLE, after every step, for both presets:
//   1. What the main key means, read by the layout's definition alone (progressWorld's `meaning`),
//      is exactly what a fresh page of EITHER release loads.
//   2. That is exactly the state of the page whose save last landed there — its own state for a
//      page of this line, what its text meant when it landed for an older page.
//   3. No chunk key was ever written twice with different text.
//   4. Every stats invariant holds in every build's view of the save, and "correct answers and
//      saved times disagree" is true in no view unless an answer really was given with timing hidden.
//   5. A main key a page of this line saved names no chunk that is missing.
// ★ THE ONE STRAND, counted rather than forbidden: an older page holding a sealed save writes after
// a page of this line deleted chunks it names (a reset, or a clear-up after a complete plain copy
// was saved over them). The counts come back, the times in those chunks do not, and they are counted
// as lost — never doubled, never a false popup. It is allowed ONLY when chunks really were deleted
// since that page loaded, and the last group below shows it cannot happen without two things: a page
// of this line deleting, and an older page already holding the sealed save.
// ★ …AND ITS TWIN, in the `stale` worlds: what a page reads of another tab's writes can lag them, so
// a page of THIS line may save having compared the main key with a copy one write out of date —
// passing over a deletion it has not been told of yet. That one save may name chunks that are gone
// (the same strand, allowed only when chunks really were deleted since the page last looked). The
// report of the other tab's write reaches it right after, and from its NEXT save on every chunk it
// names must be there again: the oracle holds it to the letter as soon as the report has arrived.
