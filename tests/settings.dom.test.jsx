// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// ⚙ Settings — DOM tests for the segmented pill trays and the radio-group a11y pass (round-8),
// extended in round-9 to pin THE PICKER RULE across the whole panel. What jsdom CAN prove, and
// does here:
//
//   • THE PICKER RULE: the panel holds exactly two kinds of control, and each has exactly one
//     treatment. A SWITCH (on/off) is one On/Off button beside its label. A PICKER (choose among
//     named alternatives) is ONE merged tray — Input and the three chance rows joined Date Format
//     and Theme in round-9, so the housing finally MEANS "these options are mutually exclusive"
//     instead of being a per-group decoration. Both halves are pinned: every picker is a tray,
//     every switch is not, and no role="radio" exists anywhere outside a tray.
//   • The conditionally-locked pickers keep their exact lock conditions through the conversion —
//     Input in Deduction, Julian Chance unless the range straddles 1582, Leap Year Chance unless a
//     leap year is reachable — with the dim on the GROUP, aria-disabled on every segment, the
//     onChange guard behind it, and the selected value preserved for when the lock clears. Jan/Feb
//     Chance is the control case: it has no lock branch at all.
//
//   • PillTray (components/PillTray) renders every group as role="radio" segments, and ONE
//     boolean — the enclosing PillGroup's `disabled` — is the whole lock: the dim class on the
//     group, aria-disabled on each segment, the onChange guard (so a click slipping past
//     pointer-events-none cannot change the value) and the missing tab stop all come from it.
//     Each of those four is asserted, and the dim is asserted as an exact class string.
//   • The five themes are two ALWAYS-PRESENT rows, not the two/three dropdowns they replaced.
//     The same rows render in both Use-System states — that is what stops the panel reflowing
//     when the switch is flipped — and only the SELECTION semantics differ: two independent
//     picks when the OS decides, exactly one pick across both rows when it doesn't.
//   • Flipping Use System Settings OFF seeds the manual theme from what is ALREADY on screen, so
//     the switch never jumps the user to a different look (the round-8 bug).
//   • THE KEYBOARD CONTRACT that role="radiogroup" promises, added in round-9 (Q2) and owned by
//     PillGroup (components/PillGroup): each group is ONE tab stop — the selected pill — with
//     Right/Down, Left/Up, Home and End moving the choice WITHIN it and wrapping, and a locked
//     group inert (no tab stop, no arrow handling — pointer-events-none stops only pointers).
//     The group, not the tray, has to own it, because two of these groups span two trays: the
//     arrow walks straight from the last Written format into the first Numeric one, and the five
//     themes are one tab stop across two rows whenever Use System is off. This is also the layer
//     the owner cannot check on a phone — there is no keyboard — so these tests ARE the pass.
//   • Every mutually-exclusive group in the panel is a role="radiogroup" of role="radio" buttons,
//     and A GROUP IS A CHOICE, NOT A ROW. Where two trays share one setting the radiogroup spans
//     both of them — the five date formats always, and the two theme rows while Use System is off
//     — because a group reporting "nothing selected" while the real pick sits in a sibling group
//     states something false. The theme grouping therefore FOLLOWS the switch, and the pills in
//     the one date-format group state their half in their accessible names, since 'MDY' and 'DMY'
//     each appear in both trays and radios in one group have to be tellable apart.
//
// What it CANNOT prove: the concentric-housing geometry, the dim, and the press-drag dismissal
// are pixels and pointers — on-device only.
//
// ── HOW THIS FILE IS ORGANISED, since the settings-panel extraction ──────────────────────────
// Everything above the PIXEL GATES divider is BEHAVIOUR, and every one of those tests reaches the
// panel through tests/helpers/settingsPanel — mounting, opening, finding a switch by its setting's
// name, asking whether a picker is locked, asking whether a footer button is being offered. None
// of them names a DOM position, an element id, or a Tailwind token, so none of them has to change
// when the panel stops being part of App. That is the point: the extraction's gate is that this
// net passes with ZERO edits, and a test you have to fix afterwards cannot be part of that gate.
//
// Below the divider are the PIXEL GATES, which are the deliberate opposite — implementation-
// coupled, exact-equality, and the owner's zero-visual-change guarantee. Their own comment block
// says what a red one there means and what the extraction owes them.

// IMPLEMENTATION. Everything else in this file goes through tests/helpers/settingsPanel so it can
// survive the panel moving out of App; these do the opposite ON PURPOSE. They assert child counts,
// element IDENTITY per index, and exact-equality class strings, because the thing they protect IS
// the markup: the owner's standing rule is that a refactor may not move a single pixel, and the
// only way to hold that line in jsdom — which lays nothing out — is to freeze what the app emits.
//
// So: do NOT route these through the abstraction, and do NOT soften them into `toContain`. An
// abstraction that made them survive a change would be an abstraction that made them pointless.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE EXTRACTION. When the panel becomes its own component, the six
// className PROP STRINGS these pin (src/main.tsx — the Date Format group, Input, Jan/Feb Chance,
// the theme wrapper and its two rows) must be carried across VERBATIM, character for character.
// If one of them changes, that is a deliberate re-blessing of the app's look: change the app, look
// at it on a device, and update the string here in the same commit. It is never a silent edit, and
// a red test here is never "the helper needs fixing".

  // ★ THE ⚙ FOOTER'S THREE BUTTONS — NEW IN ROUND 15 (B7), and the honest note is that this gate
  // did NOT cover them before. B7 was expected to force a re-blessing here and could not, because
  // nothing in this describe had ever named a footer class string: the owner's zero-pixel rule was
  // being enforced over the pickers, the theme rows and the panel's layout, and the one row that
  // was about to change its look was outside it. So this is the gate catching up, not a drift being
  // blessed — and from here a future edit to the footer's treatment cannot be silent.
  //
  // ★ WHAT CHANGED, AND THAT THE OWNER APPROVED IT. Until B7 a withheld footer button wore
  // `opacity-60 pointer-events-none`. It now wears `opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed` and carries
  // aria-disabled. pointer-events-none had to GO for the cursor to exist at all — a
  // pointer-events:none element is never hit-tested, so a cursor declared on it can never paint —
  // and the not-allowed cursor on a dimmed button is the visible change the owner was told about
  // and accepted. Inertness did not move with it: the handler guards round 14 added are what make
  // these buttons do nothing, and they are untouched.
  //
  // ⚠ THE TRAILING SPACE IN THE OFFERED STRINGS IS REAL AND IS PINNED AS SUCH. It comes from
  // tests/classGlueGuard, which fails the build unless a className literal puts a space BEFORE its
  // `${`; when the conditional then contributes nothing, that space is what is left. Normalising it
  // away here would be pinning a string the app does not emit.
