// scripts/versionLedger.mjs — THE VERSION BUMP GUARD (2026-08-10). Decides whether the version
// about to be deployed has ever been deployed to THIS site before, and refuses the deploy if it has.
// Wired as the first step of .github/workflows/deploy.yml via scripts/checkVersionLedger.mjs; the
// ledger it reads is written by the LAST step of the same workflow. Read src/appVersion.ts alongside
// this — that file carries the versioning scheme, this one enforces its one absolute rule:
//
//     ★ EVERY DEPLOY BUMPS EXACTLY ONE NUMBER, NEVER ZERO.
//       The owner's words: "no consecutive deploys should EVER have the same version number,
//       that's critical."
//
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY GIT TAGS, AND WHY NOTHING ELSE WORKS. Four designs were built up and adversarially attacked
// before this one; the record of the three that died is in PROJECT.md's version-bump-guard entry,
// and the single fact that killed all of them is worth stating here because it is not obvious:
//
//   ★★ A DEPLOY DOES NOT REQUIRE A NEW COMMIT. GitHub's "Re-run all jobs" republishes the same
//      commit, and since round 16 made DEPLOY_TS the BUILD clock, that rebuild is a genuinely
//      different artifact — different build id, differently-named bundle, a different "Last
//      Updated", and every player told an update is waiting. So any guard that asks "did the code
//      change since last time?" (diff against HEAD~1, diff against github.event.before, derive the
//      version from the commit count) is STRUCTURALLY BLIND to it: two real, different builds go
//      out wearing one number and the guard sees nothing to complain about.
//
// Only a record written BY THE DEPLOY can see that, and a git tag is the cheapest durable record
// available: it lives in the repository the deploy just built for, it needs no network call of its
// own (the checkout already fetched it), no secret, no new file, and no service that can be down.
//
// ⚠ WHY NOT "compare against what the site is serving" — the direction that looked most natural.
// GitHub Pages' CDN strips the query string from its cache key, so the usual cache-buster does not
// bust it: measured 2026-08-10, `build-id.txt?cg=<brand-new-nonce>` returned `X-Cache: HIT` under
// `Cache-Control: max-age=600`. A stale read produces a FALSE PASS — it would wave through exactly
// the duplicate it exists to catch — and it puts a network dependency inside the deploy gate, which
// can then fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the code. (The same measurement is why
// src/lib/updateCheck.ts now documents a ceiling on how fresh "Check for updates" can be.)
//
// PER-REPOSITORY, AND THAT IS CORRECT RATHER THAN A LIMITATION. Tags are not shared between the two
// repos, so each site keeps its own ledger and each build tags only the repo it is building for.
// Staging has had far more deploys than production, so the two ledgers SHOULD differ — and the
// owner's own argument settles the design: if a staging-only push did not consume a number, the next
// staging deploy would have to go BACKWARD to match production, which the strictly-greater rule
// below refuses. Every push that reaches either site consumes a version number. A skipped number
// costs nothing; a repeated one is the whole thing being prevented.
//
// STRICTLY GREATER, NOT MERELY DIFFERENT. Refusing only an exact repeat would still allow a
// downgrade, and a version that can go down cannot answer "which build is newer". Strictly greater
// delivers more than was asked for: no version is ever used twice on a site, ever.
//
// ⚠⚠ AN EMPTY LEDGER IS A FAILURE, NOT A PASS — THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE IN THIS FILE. If this guard
// treated "no tags found" as "nothing to collide with", then a checkout that did not fetch tags
// would sail through silently on every deploy forever, and nothing would look broken. That is
// precisely the shallow-clone trap scripts/buildNumber.mjs exists to prevent, in new clothes: a
// wrong answer that is entirely plausible. So the ledger must be NON-EMPTY to pass. The repository
// is seeded with one real tag before this guard ever runs (`git tag v2.19.0 50ba020`, pushed to both
// remotes), which makes "empty" mean "I cannot see the ledger" and nothing else.
//
// PURE BY CONSTRUCTION, the buildNumber.mjs / changelogStamp.mjs pattern: this module takes plain
// DATA and returns a verdict. It never runs git and never reads a file, so every branch below is
// unit-tested (tests/versionLedger.test.js) with no git process, no fixture repo and no tags to
// arrange. The wiring is the handful of lines in checkVersionLedger.mjs that cannot be subtly wrong.

// The git invocation, exported so the test asserts the exact argv rather than paraphrasing it. It is

// parseVersion refuses, so that version would land in `ignored` and be INVISIBLE to every later
// run: the same version could then deploy twice, which is the one thing this file exists to stop.
