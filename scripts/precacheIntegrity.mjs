// scripts/precacheIntegrity.mjs — the round-7 class, closed at BUILD TIME (Q10b, round 11).
//
// THE CLASS: an asset whose precache REVISION does not track its shipped BYTES. Workbox decides
// whether a client must re-download a precached file by comparing revisions, never by comparing
// content — so a file whose bytes changed while its revision did not is invisible to every client
// that already has the old copy. It stays cached forever. Round 7 shipped exactly that (the gray
// staging icons inherited the purple source files' md5), and NOTHING anywhere caught it: before
// this module, `grep -rniE "precache|revision" tests/ scripts/ .github/` returned nothing at all.
// It is also the one class the Q7 update DETECTOR is blind to by construction — the detector can
// see that the deploy differs, but the applier hands the stale revision straight back — which is
// why this guard is what makes that feature honest rather than merely confident.
//
// THE CHECK: for every precache entry in the generated dist/sw.js that carries a revision, that
// revision must equal the md5 of the file actually sitting in dist at that URL. Workbox computes
// revisions as md5 hex, and vite.config.js's testIconVariant rewrites some of them by hand — this
// verifies the result rather than trusting either. Entries with `revision: null` are skipped by
// design: those are the content-hash-named build assets (assets/index-<hash>.js), where the URL
// itself IS the fingerprint and a byte change necessarily renames the file.
//
// Wired as a build-FAILING vite plugin (vite.config.js, last of the post plugins so it sees the
// final bytes after every rewrite), not as a CI step: a check that lives in the workflow file only
// runs where the workflow runs, and a local `npm run build` could still produce a broken artifact.
// The parsing + comparison halves below are pure and exported so tests/precacheIntegrity.test.js
// can drive them with synthetic input, including the failure the class is named after.

// Pull the precache manifest out of a generated service worker. Workbox emits it as the argument
// of precacheAndRoute([...]) — minified in our build (`{url:"index.html",revision:"6623…"}`), so
// this tolerates both quoted and bare keys, either field order, and arbitrary whitespace. Entries
// contain no nested braces, so a flat {…} scan over the array text is exact.
// Throws when there is no manifest at all: a checker that silently passes on a service worker it
// could not read would be worse than no checker, because it would look like coverage.
