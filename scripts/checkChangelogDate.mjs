// scripts/checkChangelogDate.mjs — the changelog-date guard, runnable on its own.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE PLUGIN. The guard lives in vite.config.js and fails the build
// before the bundler starts, which is the fastest failure available inside `vite build` — but the
// DEPLOY does not start at the build. deploy.yml runs tests, lint, format and typecheck first, so
// in the one place the guard exists to protect, a mis-dated changelog used to cost the entire gate
// (measured: `npm test` alone is ~3 minutes) before anything looked at the date. This is the same
// check, wired as the workflow's first step, so the deploy fails in seconds with the same advice.
//
// ⚠ IT IS NOT THE AUTHORITY, AND MUST NOT BECOME ONE. vite.config.js's changelogStamp plugin stays
// the gate: a check that lives only in the workflow cannot stop a local `npm run build` from
// producing a dist whose two dates disagree, which is precisely the hole the plugin was written to
// close. This is an early WARNING SHOT that happens to be fatal — both call the same pure
// checkChangelogStamp, so they cannot drift.
//
// ⚠ THE TWO CLOCKS ARE MINUTES APART, AND THAT IS ACCEPTED. This step reads the clock when it runs;
// the build reads it again when it runs. Across a Pacific midnight the two can disagree, so this can
// pass and the build still fail (never the reverse in any way that matters — the build is the one
// that gates). Nothing is lost: the build's verdict is the real one and its message says the same
// thing.
//
// Run: `node scripts/checkChangelogDate.mjs` (Node imports src/changelog.ts directly — type
// stripping, Node 24, the same version deploy.yml pins).
