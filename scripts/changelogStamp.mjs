// scripts/changelogStamp.mjs — the deploy stamp and the changelog date, made unable to disagree
// (round 16, Q1 half 2).
//
// THE CLASS: two facts about the same deploy, written down in two places, kept in step by memory.
// src/deployStamp.ts says WHEN the build shipped; the newest entry in src/changelog.ts says WHICH
// PACIFIC DAY shipped it. Half 1 of Q1 took the stamp out of human hands — it is now the build
// machine's own clock — which removes one of the two chores and, on its own, makes the situation
// WORSE: the surviving half is a step somebody used to remember beside a step nobody has to, and a
// divergence between them would now happen silently. So the two halves only make sense together.
// This is the second half: the build FAILS unless the newest changelog entry is dated the same
// Pacific calendar day the stamp lands on.
//
// WHY PACIFIC AT ALL: the charter at the top of src/changelog.ts fixes entry dates as the deploy's
// PACIFIC calendar date (the owner's day), while the stamp is a UTC instant. Those two disagree for
// the 7–8 hours between Pacific midnight and UTC midnight — 5:00 PM PDT is already tomorrow in UTC —
// and that window is exactly where this whole guard lives. The conversion therefore goes through the
// IANA zone (Intl + 'America/Los_Angeles'), never through a hand-written offset: PDT is UTC-7 and PST
// is UTC-8, the switch moves every year, and a build in March would be a day out if -8 were baked in.
// assertPacificZone() below refuses to produce a verdict at all on a runtime whose tz database does
// not actually perform that shift, because a checker that quietly compares two UTC dates would look
// exactly like a passing one.
//
// Wired as a build-FAILING vite plugin (vite.config.js, first in the plugin array so it fails before
// the expensive work), on the precacheIntegrity precedent and for the same reason: a check that lives
// in the CI workflow only runs where the workflow runs, and a local `npm run build` could still
// produce an artifact whose two dates disagree. The comparison half below is pure and exported so
// tests/changelogStamp.test.js can drive it with synthetic instants — including both sides of both
// midnights, and both offsets — without depending on the day the suite happens to run.
