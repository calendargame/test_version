// lib/pointerGestures.ts — the global press-drag-release input controller (Q4 + Q5).
//
// Makes button activation RELEASE-based instead of press-based, with three behaviours:
//
//   • SLIDE-OFF-TO-CANCEL (every <button>): a press fires the button only if you RELEASE on it. Slide
//     your finger off and release → nothing happens (cancelled). This matches the mobile convention and
//     what a desktop mouse already does, and finally lets you escape a misclick. (Today on touch the
//     browser's implicit pointer-capture fires the ORIGINAL button no matter where the finger drifts.)
//
//   • DRAG-TO-SELECT (inside a [data-answer-grid] or [data-select-group] — "selection groups"): press an
//     option, drag across (the option under your finger highlights live — but only once you've LEFT the
//     pressed option, so a plain tap never flashes the ring; see nextHilite), release on an option →
//     THAT option activates; release outside → cancel. So a wrong first touch can be corrected by
//     sliding to the right one. Outside a group, dragging onto another button never activates it — the
//     gesture belongs to the button you pressed.
//
//   • PRESS-DRAG MENU (Q5 + C2): a press on a [data-select-trigger] (the mode selector, or the ⚙ Settings
//     button) whose own pointerdown opens a menu — you can drag straight into the menu and release on an
//     option to pick it, in one gesture. The trigger NAMES its menu via aria-controls, resolved live by
//     id (menuFor) since the menu mounts a React render after pointerdown; a press that CLOSED the menu
//     resolves to nothing and the gesture is inert. The menu is whatever element that id names — the
//     mode menu (a [data-select-group]) or the Settings panel card (deliberately NOT a drag-select
//     group, so a drag that STARTS inside the panel still scrolls natively instead of selecting).
//     Release resolution inside a
//     menu is widened to [data-drag-focus] opt-ins (the Year Range inputs): releasing on one FOCUSES it
//     (typing can start) instead of clicking. After a click-activation, a menu marked data-drag-dismiss
//     is asked to close via a bubbling "drag-dismiss" CustomEvent from the member (App listens and closes
//     Settings — its apply-on-close pass then runs naturally) unless the member sits inside a
//     [data-drag-stay] opt-out container (both footer rows, which must stay open).
//     For a menu taller than its viewport, dragging near its scroller's ([data-drag-scroll] wrapper, else
//     the menu itself) top/bottom edge AUTO-SCROLLS it so options below the fold are reachable in the one
//     gesture (autoScroll, below). Because the trigger toggles on pointerdown, its click is ALWAYS
//     suppressed (else it would double-toggle); a quick tap with no menu-open still toggles via pointerdown.
//
// HOW: one set of document capture-phase Pointer-Event listeners (unifying mouse + touch + pen). The
// gesture LATCHES onto the first PRIMARY pointer: onDown ignores non-primary pointers (a second finger
// can neither restart the gesture nor clear an armed click-suppression), and onMove/onUp/onCancel
// ignore every other pointerId. A PRIMARY press of the latched pointer's OWN type while latched means
// the latched contact already ended with its up/cancel LOST (only one pointer of a type is primary at a
// time) — the stale gesture is cleared and the press starts fresh, so a wedged latch self-heals instead
// of eating every future gesture (see onDown). On `pointerup` we read the
// element under the release point (elementFromPoint) and decide. To override the native click — which on
// touch targets the pressed button regardless of drift — we SUPPRESS it in a capture-phase `click`
// listener (it runs before React's root listener, so a suppressed click never reaches the component's
// onClick), and for a drag-to-select we synthesize a `.click()` on the release member instead. Programmatic
// `.click()`s — the keyboard shortcut handler (main.tsx: Tab → the mode trigger, 0–9 → the answer grid, the
// [data-key] walk) and PillGroup's roving-focus arrows — pass through that same capture listener and so are
// NOT exempt by construction: one is swallowed if it targets the exact element an armed suppression names,
// while that arming is live (armed by a slide-off release, or by a cancelled press on a [data-select-trigger]
// — see onCancel; cleared when a click consumes it, when the next pointerdown lands, or by armSuppress's 1s
// fallback). Reaching that needs a keyboard activation of the very button a gesture just cancelled on, within
// a second of it — and the swallowed click consumes the arming, so the next one passes.
//
// TESTABILITY: resolveRelease, resolveTriggerRelease, nextHilite, menuFor, bandDirection, and scrollDelta are pure
// (or layout-free DOM reads) and unit-tested, as are the pointer latch + click suppression via synthetic
// events; the full wiring (real pointer drags + elementFromPoint + auto-scroll feel) is verified
// on-device — jsdom has no layout engine, so elementFromPoint/getBoundingClientRect don't work there.
