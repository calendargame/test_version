// lib/accordionMotion.ts — the pure math of every accordion in the app (Q8; Q5 round-8).
//
// Kept apart from the component (components/GuidePage.tsx) for the lib/selectionGuard
// reasons: the component file only exports components (the react-refresh rule), and every
// decision here is trivially unit-testable without rendering anything. GuidePage owns the
// DOM reads (rendered heights, rects, the --seat-top / --motion-scale vars) and the rAF
// scroll writer; this module owns what the numbers MEAN: how long a toggle takes, the
// curve the panels and the writer both run, and where the window scroll must land.
//
// Q5 (round 8) widened it from "the HTP coordinator's math" to the ONE motion law: the
// codes panel (components/MethodBreakdown) now runs the same duration floor and the same
// curve, and its freeze window is derived here rather than hand-synced in a file of its
// own. The scroll math below stays guide-only — the codes panel is the last element in a
// scroll column and moves nothing above itself, so it has nothing to compensate for.

// ── Duration: d(h) = clamp(180ms + 0.14ms/px × h, ACCORDION_MS_FLOOR, 440ms) ─────────
// h = the animated content height in px. The guide's panel heights span an 18.5:1 range,
// far too wide for either one fixed duration (giants blur) or a pure per-px rate (giants
// crawl); the 180ms base + shallow 0.14ms/px slope + [240, 440] clamp compress the felt
// speed to a calm register — small panels never feel snippy (240ms floor: Classic), the
// giants stay under half a second (440ms cap, Material long1 territory: Deduction,
// Save Defaults, Buttons; Julian ≈ 329ms sits mid-slope). Rounded to whole ms: the value
// is stamped into inline styles and test pins, and sub-ms precision is imperceptible.
//
// The FLOOR is the only clamp with consumers outside this curve, so it is the only one
// named: the app's OTHER accordion — the codes panel (components/MethodBreakdown) — runs
// at exactly this duration by passing it as Expander's durationMs, CODES_CLOSE_MS below
// derives its freeze window from it, and index.css carries it as the --expander-ms
// fallback. One number, one home. (Before Q5 the codes panel ran 280ms and the guide's
// short panels 240ms — two hand-tuned literals that happened to be close; the guide's
// formula returns this floor for anything under ~429px, and the codes panel is ~72-97px,
// so the two were only ever going to be the same value. Now they ARE the same value.)
// The 440ms cap has no consumer beyond this formula and stays a literal.

// CODES_CLOSE_MS — how long the codes panel holds its FROZEN inputs (date, format,
// cellDates, Julian) after Hide Codes before releasing them to the latest values, so the
// panel's contents cannot change while it is still sliding shut. Derived, not hand-synced:
// the panel's slide IS ACCORDION_MS_FLOOR (it opts in explicitly), plus a 30ms buffer for
// the gap between the CSS transition ending and the timer firing. Owned by
// MethodBreakdownSection, which is the single implementation behind all six codes toggles.
// One caveat the arithmetic hides: under prefers-reduced-motion the slide is INSTANT
// (--motion-scale multiplies the CSS duration to 0s) while this timeout still runs its full
// length. Harmless — the panel is already closed, so the release is invisible either way —
// but the derivation is only tight at --motion-scale: 1.

// The twin-toggle shared clock: an exclusive-open accordion switch animates TWO panels
// (one closing, one opening) whose travels differ. One duration — d of the LARGER travel
// — applies to both: equal duration plus equal easing keeps the net layout delta a single

// y at the u where x(u) = t. x′(u) = 4.8u² − 2.4u + 0.6 has negative discriminant with
// a 0.3 minimum on [0,1], so x is strictly increasing and Newton's method from u = t
// converges safely (eight iterations lands far below any sub-pixel scroll tolerance).

//                 = the fixed bar's height PLUS one guide panel gap (--seat-top, registered in
//                 index.css as --bar-h + --guide-panel-gap). The gap is what makes it exact —
//                 seat the tapped panel one gap below the bar and the BOTTOM edge of the panel
//                 above it lands precisely on the bar's underside, out of frame. NOT the bar
//                 alone (that seats the previous panel's bottom a full gap into view) and NOT
//                 bar + fade, which round 8 used and which overshot by fade − gap, leaving a
//                 15.5px sliver of the previous panel showing.
//   docH          the document's current scrollHeight
//   headerDocTop  the tapped section wrapper's current document-space top
//   closingH      the closing panel's current RENDERED height (0 when nothing closes;

// Returns the document-space scrollY the coordinator's writer should glide to, or null
// when the layout change leaves the current scroll position coherent (no writer runs —
// the panels animate in place and the browser holds still; the paired guide-scoped
// overflow-anchor:none rule in index.css guarantees "holds still" on every engine).
//
// Scenario A — a panel OPENS (owner rule): compensate ONLY when the opened panel's start
// (its header) would land above the reading line. The comparison baseline is where the
// browser will have settled AFTER the toggle — scrollY clamped into the final scroll
// range — plus the seat the header must clear. Target: the header seated exactly on the
// reading line. (The final-range clamps on the target are pure defense: A's own inequality
// already bounds it below the settled position.) A returns null when the glide would be
// under a pixel: the target is built from fractional rects, so a rest position can differ
// from its own recomputed seat by a fraction, and running a 240-440ms animation to erase
// a third of a pixel is visible motion for no visible correction. Scenario B has no such
// epsilon on purpose — there the current position is genuinely OUT of the final scroll
// range, so the browser is going to move it whatever we do; the only question is whether
// the move rides the panels' clock or snaps in one frame.
//
// A cannot always DELIVER the seat, and that is a fact about the page, not a bug in the rule:
// tap one of the last section or two and finalMaxScroll is smaller than the seat the header
// wants, so the target clamps short and the panel above stays partly visible. The document
// simply cannot scroll far enough. The only "fix" would be padding the bottom of the guide
// with empty space to buy scroll range, which is visible dead space on every other tap. Do
// not add one.
//
// Scenario B — the toggle SHRINKS the document past the current position: the browser
// would clamp scrollY the instant the panel finished, flinging the page in a single
// frame (the captured 744px/150ms clamp-fling). Gliding to the final max-scroll on the
// panels' own clock makes the collapse and the travel one coherent motion. Checked for
// closes AND as the fallback for a net-shrinking switch where A declined.
