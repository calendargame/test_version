// lib/presetReorder.ts — the PURE decision logic behind dragging a preset row into a new position
// (components/PresetManager's reorder handle, round 20, replacing the ↑/↓ buttons). Split from
// the DOM/pointer wiring for the same reason lib/presetNameWidth splits its measurement from its
// decision: jsdom has no layout engine (getBoundingClientRect reports 0 for every element), so any
// claim about "which slot is the pointer over right now" has to be provably correct against
// FABRICATED numbers, independent of a real render. The DOM half — reading each row's real
// position via one getBoundingClientRect per row, writing the live transform, and calling
// store/presetControl's movePreset — lives in the component; this file owns only the arithmetic.
//
// ── THE MODEL, AND WHY IT COMMITS AT THE DROP RATHER THAN LIVE, CROSSING BY CROSSING ────────────
//
// A drag never rewrites the registry while it is in flight. The row list stays in its PRE-drag
// order for the whole gesture; what moves is only the DRAGGED row's own on-screen position (glued
// to the pointer via a transform) and, for every row between its start slot and wherever it is
// hovering now, a one-row-height nudge that previews where it will land (previewShift below).
// Nothing is written to the store until the finger lifts, at which point stepsToReorder turns
// "started at index A, released over index B" into the exact sequence of ±1 movePreset calls the
// KEYBOARD path already makes, one adjacent swap at a time — a splice-style move and a chain of
// adjacent swaps land on the identical final order (every element strictly between A and B shifts
// by exactly one slot, the moved element lands at B), so no new, position-based primitive is needed
// in store/presetControl.ts for this either: dragging and the arrow keys both ultimately do nothing
// but call the same bounds-checked ±1 swap.
//
// ⚠ THE LIVE, CROSSING-BY-CROSSING ALTERNATIVE WAS CONSIDERED AND DROPPED, and it is a legitimate
// design (Trello, Notion and iOS Reminders all do it that way) — the reason against it here is
// implementation risk, not correctness. It couples two things that are each simple alone and
// treacherous together: the dragged row's on-screen position (which must track the pointer exactly,
// every frame, or the drag feels broken) and its DOM-FLOW position (which would keep moving out
// from under it every time a live store write reordered the list mid-gesture) — keeping the two in
// agreement needs the transform to UN-DO the flow move on every single swap, and that correction is
// exactly the kind of arithmetic that is easy to get a sign wrong in, easy to pass in a Chromium
// preview with the wrong sign (the row would drift rather than glue, which reads as "a bit floaty"
// rather than "broken" on a mouse), and impossible to verify here at all. Committing once, at the
// finger lift, removes the feedback loop entirely: the dragged row's transform is always just "how
// far the pointer has moved since the grab," full stop, and the preview nudge on every OTHER row is
// a pure function of where the pointer is now — nothing here ever has to reconcile itself against a
// store write that already happened underneath it mid-gesture. The visible result during the drag
// is the same live "cards shifting to make room" feel a crossing-by-crossing design gives; only the
// moment the REGISTRY itself changes is different (once, at release, instead of many times during).

/**
 * Which slot the dragged row is over: the one whose CENTER is nearest the dragged row's own current
 * center. `slotMidpoints` are the vertical centers every row occupied at the moment the drag
 * started — ascending, top to bottom, one entry per row in its PRE-drag order. Any one coordinate
 * space will do so long as `centerY` is in the same one — the caller uses the list's scrollable
 * CONTENT (see clampDragCenter).
 *
 * ★ NEAREST, SO A ROW GIVES WAY WHEN THE DRAGGED ROW IS HALFWAY ONTO IT — IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. The
 * boundary between two slots is the point midway between their centers, and it is the same boundary
 * whichever way the row is travelling. Two things follow, and both are why this is the rule:
 *   1. A PRESS THAT DOES NOT MOVE CHANGES NOTHING, AND NEITHER DOES A SMALL WOBBLE. The dragged
 *      row's own slot owns half a row's travel either side of where it started.
 *   2. THE DRAGGED ROW NEVER SITS CLOSER THAN HALF A ROW TO ANY OTHER ROW. The slot it is nearest
 *      is the one the others have vacated for it (previewShift), so every row still in the list is
 *      at least half a row-pitch away from it, above or below. That is what lets the dragged row's
 *      bare marks — its grip and its ✓ — travel without ever coming to rest on the same marks of the
 *      row underneath (components/PresetManager draws the row with no surface behind them; the
 *      "held row" rules in index.css cover the instant a row slides past underneath).
 * The rule this replaced asked "which is the first slot whose center the dragged center has not
 * yet passed", which is not symmetric: one pixel of travel DOWN already claimed the next slot,
 * while travelling UP needed a whole row. Released after that one pixel, two presets swapped; and
 * mid-drag the row below jumped up underneath the dragged row while the two were still all but
 * coincident — their grips drawn one on top of the other.
 *
 * A tie (exactly midway) stays with the EARLIER slot, so the answer never depends on float noise in
 * the caller's arithmetic going one way or the other between two frames of a still finger.

 * the same space `slotMidpoints` is captured in.
 *
 * Two bounds, applied in this order:
 *   1. THE LIST'S OWN SLOTS. A row can only ever land between the first slot and the last, so there
 *      is nothing for it to be dragged toward beyond them — and drawing it there is exactly the bug
 *      the owner photographed: the row sliding up over the Presets popup's description text, or
 *      down past the list's foot. Clamping the CENTER to the first/last slot's center keeps the row
 *      inside the band the list itself occupies.
 *   2. THE PART OF THE LIST THAT IS ON SCREEN AND UNFADED (`visibleTop`/`visibleBottom`: scrollTop
 *      and scrollTop + clientHeight, each pulled in by edgeFadeInset below while that edge's fade
 *      is showing). Unlimited presets make a list taller than its scroll region the ordinary case,
 *      and a row dragged past the region's edge would be clipped out of sight — or dissolved by
 *      the edge fade — while it was still in the player's hand. So it stops, whole, `halfRow` in
 *      from that bound, and the edge auto-scroll (autoScrollDirection below) brings the rest of
 *      the list to it, the way iOS's own reorder lists behave.
 *      ⚠ SKIPPED WHEN THE REGION CANNOT HOLD ONE WHOLE ROW (visibleBottom − visibleTop < 2·halfRow),
 *      where "fully visible" has no answer at all. No real layout of this card gets there (the list
 *      is at least one row tall by construction); it is the honest answer rather than an inverted
 *      range, and it is also what a layout-free test environment reports (every size 0).
 * The slot bound wins wherever the two disagree: it is the one that is about the list's meaning.
