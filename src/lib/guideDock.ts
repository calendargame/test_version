// lib/guideDock.ts — ONE SHADOW, UNDER WHICHEVER EDGE THE TEXT IS SLIDING BENEATH.
//
// How to Play has two edges that text can slide under: the fixed top bar's underside, and — while
// a section is open — the underside of that section's header, which docks flush against the bar
// and stays there as the section scrolls (components/GuidePage; index.css's .guide-head is the
// stick itself). A boundary shadow means "content is sliding under this edge", so at any moment
// only ONE of the two may wear it:
//
//   • while the open header is docked against the bar, the BAR'S shadow is off — what is directly
//     under the bar is the header, which is not sliding anywhere — and the HEADER wears the shadow
//     once the section's text is actually under it;
//   • while no header is docked, the bar's shadow is whatever the page's scroll position makes it,
//     exactly as on every other screen, and the header wears none.
//
// This file is that decision and nothing else: pure arithmetic over five numbers read off the
// screen, so the hand-off can be proved for every position without a layout engine (jsdom has
// none). The component measures and writes; it decides nothing.
//
// ── THE THREE DISTANCES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// All in px, all in viewport coordinates, all read in the same frame:
//
//   depth   how far the stick has carried the header DOWN from its natural spot in its section
//           (headerTop − naturalTop). 0 until the header docks; from then on it is exactly how much
//           of the section has scrolled up under the header.
//   room    how much of the section is still BELOW the header (floorY − headerBottom). A sticky
//           header cannot leave its own section, so when this reaches 0 the section's foot has
//           arrived and starts carrying the header up under the bar with it.
//   offset  how far the header's top is from the bar's underside (|headerTop − lineY|), either way:
//           below it while the header is still on its way up the page, above it while the section's
//           foot is carrying it out.
//
// ── THE TWO STRENGTHS, AND WHY THEY CAN NEVER BOTH BE ON ────────────────────────────────────
//
//   header   = the weaker of ramp(depth) and ramp(room). Text has to be under the header for it to
//              cast a shadow (depth), and there has to be section left below it for the shadow to
//              fall on (room) — it fades out over the section's last stretch rather than vanishing
//              when the foot arrives.
//   barYield = ramp(offset): the fraction of its own shadow the bar keeps. 0 with the header docked
//              flush, back to 1 once the header is a ramp's length away in either direction — so
//              the bar's shadow fades out as an opening section glides up to dock, and fades back
//              in as a finished section slides away under the bar. The caller multiplies the bar's
//              ordinary scroll-driven strength by it.
//
// The ramp is the app's one "near a boundary" distance (--fade-h, components/scrollRegion's
// edgeShade), so both shadows speak the language every other boundary shadow speaks.
//
// A header casts a shadow only while it is STUCK (depth > 0 and room > 0), and a stuck header's top
// is on the line (offset 0), where the bar keeps nothing. A header off the line is either not yet
// docked (depth 0) or being carried out (room 0), and casts nothing. So the two are never on
// together, at any position — and the function ENFORCES that rather than trusting it: whenever the
// header's strength is above 0 the bar's share is 0 outright, so no sub-pixel disagreement between
// two measured rectangles can ever light both.
//
// There is also no position with NEITHER while text is under an edge: off the line the bar keeps a
// share of its shadow; on the line, the header's shadow is on whenever text is under the header.
// The one place both are 0 is a header docked with nothing under it yet — a section just opened —
// which is exactly the case that must not look pinned.
//
// ── TWO MOMENTS THE POSITION ALONE GETS WRONG ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Both are a tap on a header, and in both the numbers above are true and the picture is not:
//
//   ARRIVING — a section is opened while its header's natural spot is ABOVE the line (the header
//     was partly under the bar when it was tapped, or the keyboard opened it). The stick puts it on
//     the line at once, carried down from that spot, so `depth` is above 0 and the rule above would
//     light its shadow — for the length of the glide that is bringing the section down to meet it,
//     going out as the glide lands. That is a section being OPENED looking pinned, which is the one
//     thing these headers must never do. While the glide is in flight the header casts nothing
//     (dockShades' `arriving`); the bar's share follows the header's place as always.
//
//   RELEASING — a section is closed, or swapped for another, from its docked header. The moment it
//     is no longer the open section nothing is docked, and by position alone the bar is owed its
//     whole shadow and the header none: the bar's went from nothing to full, and the header's from
//     full to nothing, in ONE frame, while the panel under the header took a third of a second to
//     fold away. So the hand-back is spread over that same fold (releaseShades): the header's
//     shadow goes out as the text it was cast on does, and the bar's share rises to meet whatever
//     the position then says — never above it (the caller takes the smaller of the two).
import { edgeShade } from '../components/scrollRegion.js'

// A docked header counts as having text under it only past this depth. A section that has just been
// opened is glided to the line and lands on a whole pixel (lib/accordionMotion ceils its target, and
// says why), which can leave the header carried a fraction of a pixel down its section — over the
// first sliver of the panel's own empty top padding, not over text. One pixel absorbs that, so a
// freshly opened section shows no shadow at all, and it is far inside the padding (4px) that sits
// above the first line of text.
