// lib/buildStamp.ts — the last-run build stamp (round-6 Q2): which build's DEPLOY_TS this device
// last booted, persisted in PLAIN localStorage — deliberately not a zustand store, because it
// describes the CODE that ran (not user data) and must be readable synchronously at boot, before
// anything else. Every boot restamps; a mismatch between the stored stamp and the running build is
// how an update that landed SILENTLY is detected: closing the app releases the old service
// worker's last client, the browser completes the waiting worker's activation in the background,
// and the next open is already the new version with nothing left for the auto-update flow to
// bridge (an evicted Safari tab's fresh download reads the same way). App's build-change flash
// effect (main.tsx) owns the one detection per boot and turns it into the brief Updating screen;
// the changelog's update-signal dots (Q6 — src/changelog) light off the same detection there,
// before the restamp. try/catch throughout: localStorage can throw (privacy
// modes) and a broken stamp must never break boot — a blocked read acts like a first visit
// (nothing to announce).
