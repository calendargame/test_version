// lib/buildStamp.ts — the last-run build stamp (round 6): which build's DEPLOY_TS this device
// last booted, persisted in PLAIN localStorage — deliberately not a zustand store, because it
// describes the CODE that ran (not user data) and must be readable synchronously at boot, before
// anything else. It is WRITTEN through the storage door all the same (store/storageHealth's
// tryWriteItem), so that the count of how full the device is hears of it the moment it lands
// (store/storageUsage); a stamp the device has no room for is simply not written — nothing is held
// for it and no notice opens.
// Every boot restamps; a mismatch between the stored stamp and the running build is how an update that landed SILENTLY is detected: closing the app releases the old service
// worker's last client, the browser completes the waiting worker's activation in the background,
// and the next open is already the new version with nothing left for the auto-update flow to
// bridge (an evicted Safari tab's fresh download reads the same way). App's build-change flash
// effect (main.tsx) owns the one detection per boot and turns it into the brief Updating screen;
// the changelog's GEAR dot (src/changelog) lights off the same detection there, while the
// CHANGELOG dot needs that detection AND a changed newest entry (see CHANGELOG_SEEN_KEY),
// before the restamp. try/catch throughout: localStorage can throw (privacy
// modes) and a broken stamp must never break boot — a blocked read acts like a first visit
// (nothing to announce).
