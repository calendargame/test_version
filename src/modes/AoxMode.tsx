// AoxMode — the MEAN-of-X screen: a timed run of N questions averaged, its own Best standing, and
// the Allow Mistakes / One-By-One sub-modes. Extracted verbatim from main.tsx (the main.tsx split); it was
// already a module-level sibling of App taking everything through props, so nothing about its
// behaviour changes by living here.
//
// ★ THE MODE IS "MoX" TO THE PLAYER AND "Aox/aox" IN THE CODE, ON PURPOSE — read this before
// "finishing" the rename, because the mismatch is the decision, not an oversight.
// WHY THE PLAYER-FACING NAME CHANGED (owner, sub-group 3C): this screen's headline figure is a
// straight arithmetic MEAN of every solve. It does not trim, and it never has. Cubers reserve
// "average" for a TRIMMED figure (an Ao5 drops the best and the worst) and use "Mo3" for exactly
// an untrimmed mean — so "AoX"/"Average" was telling the one audience that knows the difference
// the wrong thing. Every label a player reads is now Mean / MoX. ⚠ NO TRIMMING WAS ADDED: the
// arithmetic is byte-identical, this was a naming defect and only a naming defect.
// WHY THE IDENTIFIERS DID NOT FOLLOW: `aoxN`, `aoxBest`, `aoxAllowMistakes`, `aoxOneByOne` and
// `aoxTimingOff` are PERSISTED FIELD NAMES inside the saved `cg-progress` / mode-prefs payloads,
// and `bestKey` (below) is a config string that is itself a saved map key. Renaming them buys the
// player nothing and costs a store migration per field, with every existing Best and every saved
// personal default riding on it getting the migration right. The anchor is therefore the saved
// data, and everything internal matches the anchor — one name in the code, not two. What is NOT
// acceptable is a half-rename (`MoxMode` reading `aoxBest`), which is the state this note exists
// to prevent.
// ⚠ AND THE BESTS CARRY OVER BECAUSE NOTHING KEYED ON THE LABEL. `bestKey` is built from n,
// allowMistakes, the format bucket, the three chances, the year range and useJulian — no display
// string anywhere in it — and the store field is `aoxBest`, untouched. So a player who had a Best
// Average yesterday sees the same number under "Best Mean" today, with no migration and no version
// bump. (Pinned by tests/moxRename.dom — a Best recorded under the old label is still found.)

  // once it is given an `onActivate` (a button inside a button is invalid HTML), so wiring the opener
  // to a failed run while `tFn` stayed live would have silently deleted the toggle AND left a player
  // who had hidden the trio looking at three blank boxes on a result screen, with no tap left that
  // could reveal them. The one coherent end state is the one Blitz already had for a lost round —
  // Blitz's `timerDone` covers a sudden-death loss, and its note argues the masking at length: the
  // ended strip shows its times, takes no per-cell tap, and its one gesture opens the breakdown. So
  // the two sibling modes now agree about a run that ended badly exactly as they agree about one
  // that ended well. The pref is only MASKED here, never written: an Override that credits the
  // failing wrong resumes the run (`runPhase` back to 'running') and the hide the player chose is
  // back, untouched.
  // `isLocked` is the flag, used directly rather than through a second name: it is defined as
  // done || failed, which is precisely "this run has ended", and a separate `runEnded` would be the

  // Tapping ANYWHERE on the stat strip of an ENDED run — completed or failed — opens the
  // solve-by-solve breakdown.
  //
  // ★ WHY THE GESTURE IS FREE, verified rather than assumed: on an ended run every one of the six
  // boxes is already inert — the scoring trio never had an `fn`, and the timing trio's `tFn` goes
  // null on `isLocked` just above (an ended strip is a result readout, not a control). So the strip
  // has a tap going spare and no competing meaning to displace. StatPanel enforces the exclusivity
  // structurally: given an `onActivate` it ignores every per-cell `fn`, so this can never become a
  // button inside a button even if that line above changes.
  //
  // ★ A FAILED RUN'S BREAKDOWN IS THE RUN UP TO THE FAILURE, and nothing had to be built for it:
  // engine/runBreakdown is a pure walk of the engine state, and the card that failed the run took
  // its `played` increment at the action that failed it — so it is the last row, marked (missed,
  // shown, or overridden) and untimed, and the summary's mean is the mean of what WAS solved, the
  // same number the strip prints. (tests/engine/runBreakdown pins each way a run can fail.)
  //
  // ⚠ AND IT IS GATED ON saveStats. With Save Stats off the strip is dimmed and every value reads
  // '—' — the app saying "nothing is being recorded". A door on that strip leading to the real
  // times would contradict it in the same tap. (The run itself still tracks, as it always has; this
  // is about what the screen is willing to claim.)
  //
  // ⚠ AND ON `visible`, which is not paranoia — it is the one guard the mode's own display:none
  // cannot supply. The popup PORTALS to #root, so it sits outside this screen's hidden wrapper: a
  // run left finished on screen and then a keyboard mode-switch (the shortcut keys still fire while
  // the panel is up) would leave this card floating over a different mode. Gating availability on

  // acts on, so the phase and the score can never be told different stories.
  //
  // ★ THE PHASE STAYS EVENT-DRIVEN, AND DERIVING IT WOULD BE A TRAP. "good ≥ n ⇒ done" reads like the
  // whole rule, but a press on a card of a DONE run that retracts a credit would then flip the phase
  // to 'running' — and 'running' disables Back and Forward, which would strand the player mid-browse
  // with no way out but Reset. So each press says what it does to the phase, and nothing else does.
  //
  // The three rules, and what deliberately has none:
  //   • a press that leaves a card a MISS with Allow Mistakes off FAILS the run — the long-standing
  //     "an override to a wrong is a mistake like any other", now reachable from the Undo direction;
  //   • a press that CREDITS while the run is failed, at the live edge, leaving no miss behind it,
  //     resumes it — and the completion effect then flips a completing one straight to 'done';
  //   • a press that takes the HELD COMPLETING SOLVE's credit away (Allow Mistakes on — with it off the
  //     first rule already fired) hands the run back as 'running'. The card stays on screen as a
  //     resolved miss and the existing Next button carries the run on (see `awaitingNext`). ONLY WHEN
  //     THE RUN IS THEN SHORT OF ITS N: a done run can hold more than N credits (a miss credited
  //     after it completed), and taking the held solve's credit from one of those leaves a run that
  //     still stands — nothing to hand back, so it stays done. (It used to go 'running' for one commit
  //     and be completed again by the effect above: a second "completion" of a run that never
  //     stopped standing.)
  //   • a press on a HISTORY card of a done run changes no phase at all: the run is over, and the only
  //     thing that reacts is reconcileAoxStanding, which raises or restores the Best from the floor.
  // preRunBestRef, recordedRef and `runId` are NEVER written here — only begin() and reset() write

    //     run, a question nobody can answer (the screen then hid it as "—", and the card just credited

              line box, and WebKit's machinery for a text control lands ~2px away from its machinery for a
              button. Under items-center that split rendered symmetrically — the box sitting ~1px proud
              above AND below its neighbors on the owner's iPhone. Matching class strings can't fix it
              (they already match exactly, which is why two earlier attempts failed): the row is made even
              by STRETCHING the shorter items to the tallest, not by arguing the derived heights agree.
              The wrapper below restates it so the input inherits the row's height through it; the 'Ao'
              span opts back out with self-center (a stretched span rides its text at the top). */}

                popup N field's validation trio — digits only while typing, blur and Enter
                normalize-commit with the shared clamp (normalizeAoxN), and ESCAPE DISCARDS.
                text-xs on the 'Mo' span too, so "Mo10" reads as one flush token.
                ★ ESCAPE DISCARDS — round 15, and it used to normalize-COMMIT like the other
                two. Escape now means one thing in every box you can type a NUMBER into, which the
                ⚙ Year Range boxes have meant since round 14 and the tap-to-type slider readouts
                since round 2: Enter keeps the edit and lets go, Escape throws it away and lets go,
                and the container is left for a second Escape. This field was the last NUMERIC one
                still committing the value it was asked to discard.
                ★ AND SINCE ROUND 17 IT REALLY IS EVERYWHERE YOU CAN TYPE. This note used to carve
                out the Lookup date field (components/LookupCard) as the one text box outside the
                contract — an open gap rather than a decision. The owner took the decision: that
                box captures its text on focus and discards back to it, so there is no exception
                left, here or in the How-to-Play guide.
                ⚠ THE DISCARD TARGET HAS TO BE REMEMBERED, because this box is not a mirror. The ⚙
                year boxes revert to minY/maxY — a committed value sitting right beside the text —
                but `aoxN` IS the stored pref: onChange writes it on every keystroke, so by the time
                Escape arrives the value the user is discarding BACK to no longer exists anywhere.
                aoxNAtFocusRef captures it on focus, which is the honest definition of "the edit"
                (an edit begins when the keyboard enters the box). Restoring an un-normalized
                capture is safe: the blur that follows normalizes it, exactly as it would have.
                ⚠ NOTHING ELSE ANSWERS THIS PRESS. Escape also closes the top open layer (the ⚙ panel,
                a popup — components/overlayStack), but that rule stands aside whenever a text box
                has the keyboard, so the first Escape is always the box's and a second, with nothing
                being typed, is the layer's. */}

                is idle, or a One-by-One date is still hidden. Passing null then is how Blitz and Flash
                already spell the same thing, and it drives the disabled classes, the aria-disabled and
                the panel's closed state off one value. `codesDisabled` can only turn true in the same
                React update that clears calcOpen (reset / hidden-mid-run batch resetStats with the
                phase; onNext closes the panel before hiding the next date), so the section's
                date-removed auto-close never fires here — it is a backstop, not a path.
                What the fold FIXED: AoX's private freeze effect held only the DATE, so a format or
                Julian change during the close leaked into the sliding panel; and it cleared its
                was-open flag immediately, so tapping ">" inside the freeze window (Forward closes the
                panel AND changes the date) fell through to the live values and swapped the panel's
                contents while it was still visibly sliding shut. The shared effect freezes all four
                inputs and re-arms on a dep change via its closingRef. */}
