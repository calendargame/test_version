// AoxMode — the "average of N" run mode, FOLDED onto the shared useGameEngine (mode-untangle
// Step 5, redone). Like Blitz, the engine runs the per-question loop (answer / credit / stats /
// history / Override / Show Codes) and the COMPONENT owns the run layer: the run lifecycle
// (idle/running/done/failed), the Ao-N count, Best Average/Median (per config, with rollback),
// One-by-One, and the fail-on-mistake rule. The run's stats ARE the engine stats — good =
// credited solves, played = attempts, times = solve times, streak/best. The fold needs only
// two general engine flags: `complete` (the Nth solve credits without advancing) and
// `noAdvance` (a failing override of that solve stays put). See gameReducer.

              line box, and WebKit's machinery for a text control lands ~2px away from its machinery for a

              by STRETCHING the shorter items to the tallest, not by arguing the derived heights agree.

                (Q5, round 8). AoX's gate isn't "is there a date" but "is the date SHOWABLE": the run
                is idle, or a One-by-One date is still hidden. Passing null then is how Blitz and Flash
                already spell the same thing, and it drives the disabled classes, the aria-disabled and
                the panel's closed state off one value. `codesDisabled` can only turn true in the same
                React update that clears calcOpen (reset / hidden-mid-run batch resetStats with the
                phase; onNext closes the panel before hiding the next date), so the section's
                date-removed auto-close never fires here — it is a backstop, not a path.
                What the fold FIXED: AoX's private freeze effect held only the DATE, so a format or
                Julian change during the close leaked into the sliding panel; and it cleared its
                was-open flag immediately, so tapping ">" inside the freeze window (Forward closes the
                panel AND changes the date) fell through to the live values and swapped the panel's
                contents while it was still visibly sliding shut. The shared effect freezes all four
                inputs and re-arms on a dep change via its closingRef. */}
