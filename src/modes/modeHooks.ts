// once, and store/progress' v5 migration recorded how many as `timesLost`, so they never read as a

// the mode-prefs store, so they're passed in with their setters (timingOff also feeds useGameEngine).
//
// ★ TURNING TIMING BACK ON IS ONE ACT ON EVERY ENGINE THE SWITCH COVERS (`timed`). A mode has ONE
// timing switch; Classic and Flash have one engine behind it, Deduction has three (its Day, Month
// and Year silos, each with its own stats and its own waiting puzzle). From the moment timing is
// shown a first-try answer records a solve time — in EVERY one of those silos, not just the one on
// screen — so each of them is settled by the same two rules:
//   • a silo whose stats moved while timing was hidden (timingMismatch) cannot be reconciled and
//     has to be RESET — which the player is asked about first ("Enable and Reset Stats?", a shared
//     ConfirmModal the mode component renders; this hook owns its open flag and its two handlers);
//   • every other silo follows the LIVE-QUESTION RULE (restoredEngine, below): its waiting question
//     is regenerated unless it has been used.
// So the check and the reset agree by construction: the popup opens when ANY covered silo is
// mismatched, and accepting it resets exactly the mismatched ones and regenerates the rest.
// (It used to look at, and act on, the engine on screen alone. In Deduction that left the other two
// sub-types holding a puzzle the player had already studied — its solve time would then start from
// whenever they next looked at it — and let timing come on over a hidden sub-type whose readouts
// and recorded times disagreed, the very state the popup exists to prevent.)
//
// Flash is the only mode that keeps something of its own about the waiting question (a running
// flash, a date left showing), so it passes onQuestionReplaced() — called when turning timing back
// on actually REPLACED that question, and never when the engine kept it — and onHide() (on
