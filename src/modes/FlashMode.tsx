//
// Self-contained + always-mounted like ClassicMode/AoxMode. Reuses useGameEngine for ALL
// engine behavior (answer/override/stats/history); adds only Flash's brief-reveal TIMER:
// Begin advances to a fresh date + reveals it for flashMs, then it hides ("…") and you
// answer from memory; answering, Reveal, or Override ends the flash. The timer (setTimeout
// + rAF + the bar) is component-owned side-effect — the pure reducer never sees it.
// (Chrome — stats strip, toggles, freshness, settings-regen — currently mirrors
// ClassicMode; that duplication gets factored into a shared shell in Step 6, once all
// modes' variations are known.)
