  // press after it can end it again without a single date being answered in between (Override, then

  // desync (structurally desync-proof). (Persisted as blitzTimingOff — excluded from the defaults
  // system.) Save Stats off drops the toggle, exactly as it does for the scoring trio.
  //
  // ★ `off` is the USER'S hide toggle and nothing else (round 16) — so it is `timeHidden`
  // below and NOT a `!saveStats` term, and the scoring trio (Score/Accuracy/Streak — untoggleable,
  // the score IS the mode) carries no `off` at all. The Save-Stats fact is `dimmed` on the panel
  // below: one flag, whole strip.
  //
  // ★★ HIDING QUIETS ONLY A ROUND THAT IS STILL GOING. An ENDED round (`timerDone`) shows its
  // times and drops the toggle — the same guard AoX carries on a completed run, and Blitz was the
  // one mode missing it, so its time boxes stayed tappable on a screen where AoX's were already
  // inert. Two sibling modes disagreeing about the same screen.
  //
  // WHY `timerDone` IS THE SIGNAL, and it is worth being exact because Blitz names nothing
  // "complete". `setTimerDone(true)` has exactly ONE writer — settleEnded(), reached through endRound()
  // or through an Undo re-ending a round its Override had resumed — and EVERY way a round can finish
  // routes through it, in BOTH timing sub-modes: the Per Round countdown hitting 0, any
  // single question's Per Question clock hitting 0, a wrong answer with Allow Mistakes off, Reveal,
  // Show Codes, and an override-to-wrong with Allow Mistakes off. (The ⚙ panel is NOT one of them:
  // opening it leaves the round running, and closing it after changing a setting the round depends on
  // RESETS the round to idle rather than ending it — the useSettingsCloseEffect above.) So there is
  // no per-sub-mode branch to write here: one flag already means "this round is over" everywhere.
  // It is also the flag the Best-reconcile effect gates on — a Blitz round that ends on a wrong in
  // sudden death still RECORDS its result, so it is a finished round, not an abandoned one. AoX
  // makes the same call from the other direction: its failed run records no Best, and since round
  // 22 its strip is STILL a result readout (its `isLocked` is done OR failed), because what an ended
  // strip owes the player is the times it ran up, not a verdict on how it ended. The two modes agree.
  //
  // ⚠ BOTH HALVES MOVE TOGETHER — dropping `fn` while leaving `off: timingOff` would be a trap, not
  // half a fix. Tapping a time box is the ONLY writer of blitzTimingOff in the whole app (it is
  // excluded from the defaults system and survives Reset Settings; only Full Reset clears it), so a
  // player who had hidden the trio would end a round facing three blank boxes and no way to reveal
  // the round's own times without resetting the round away. Masking the pref on this screen and
  // taking the toggle with it is one coherent state: the ended strip is a plain result readout.
  // The pref itself is never written here — resume an ended round via Override (resumeRound clears
  // timerDone) and the hide the player chose is back, untouched.
  //
  // ⚠ With Save Stats OFF the whole strip is dimmed to '—' and `tFn` was already null; an ended
  // round now reads '—' there rather than blank, because `timeHidden` goes false. That is the
  // dimmed strip's uniform statement and it is exactly what AoX does in the same state.

  // ── THE ROUND BREAKDOWN (sub-group 3C) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // The same panel MoX opens, on the same gesture and for the same reason: an ENDED round's stat
  // strip is already inert (the line above drops `tFn` on `timerDone`, and the scoring boxes never
  // had one), so tapping anywhere on it opens the round solve-by-solve. It fell out of the MoX work
  // for the price of these three lines because Blitz's Begin is a full engine RESET — so the round's
  // history IS the whole engine history, and the times ledger's carried-in count is 0, which is what
  // makes the rows add up to the strip's Mean exactly.
  // ⚠ `timerDone` is the right flag: every way a Blitz round can end routes through settleEnded(),
  // sudden-death losses included, so a lost round opens its breakdown exactly like one the clock
  // ended — the rule AoX adopted for its failed runs in round 22 (its `isLocked`). (The long
  // argument is in the timing note directly above.) Gated on `saveStats` for the reason MoX is: a
  // dimmed strip reading '—' must not be a door to the numbers it is declining to show.
  //
