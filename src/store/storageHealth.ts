// store/storageHealth.ts — A SAVE THE DEVICE REFUSES IS NEVER SILENT, AND NEVER GOES ANYWHERE ELSE.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Every solve time is kept (store/progress), so the saved data grows with play, and a
// browser gives each site a fixed allowance (~5 MB in Chromium and Safari, shared by every preset).
// When a save does not fit, localStorage.setItem throws a QuotaExceededError — and zustand's persist
// does NOT catch it: the throw came straight out of the store's setter. For the stats that setter
// runs in a mode screen's effect, so a full device did not "stop saving quietly", it put the player
// on the error card on their next answer.
//
// ★ WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD — the whole mechanism. Every saved value of every persisted store is read,
// written and removed through the three functions below, and a write the device refuses is caught
// and HELD IN MEMORY UNDER THE EXACT PLACE IT WAS FOR: this storage area, this key. From then on:
//   • a READ of that place returns the held value — it is what that place would hold if it had fit.
//     So anything that re-reads saved data inside this page (a preset switch and the switch back, an
//     Amnesic toggle, "is this preset factory-fresh?") sees the player's newest answers, not the
//     older copy on the device;
//   • the next write that DOES fit (or the app itself freeing space — a preset deleted) retries
//     every held value, each to its own place and nowhere else;
//   • REMOVING a place forgets what was held for it: a deleted preset's keys, a guest session being
//     thrown away. A held value can never bring back something the player deleted;
//   • ANOTHER TAB changing a place forgets what was held for it too (placeChangedElsewhere): the
//     held value stands in for what that place would hold if the save had fit, and a save that had
//     fit would have been replaced by the other tab's later one;
//   • the first refusal of an episode opens components/StorageFullNotice, which tells the player
//     what happened and how to make room; it does not reopen on every answer while the device stays
//     full.
// ⚠ WHAT IS STILL LOST, and the notice has to say so: held values live in this page's memory, so
// CLOSING OR RELOADING the app while the device is still full loses them. The app holds its own
// reload for exactly that reason (src/main.tsx's applyUpdate); it cannot hold the player's.
//
// ★ WHY THE HELD VALUE IS KEYED BY ITS DESTINATION, AND NOT RE-MADE FROM THE STORE. The first design
// remembered only WHICH store had been refused and re-saved "what that store holds now" through the
// store's own adapter. That adapter writes to whichever preset is active AT THE MOMENT OF THE RETRY —
// and the retry ran inside the registry write of a preset switch, a preset delete and an Amnesic
// toggle, i.e. after the registry named the incoming preset and before the stores had reloaded. One
// preset's stats were written over another's, and a guest's session over the permanent copy. A value
// held under its own destination has no adapter to be redirected by: the retry is that string, to
// that key, in that area.
//
// ⚠ ONLY A QUOTA REFUSAL IS CAUGHT. Any other storage error is rethrown exactly as before: this file
// answers "the device is full", and swallowing a different failure here would hide it behind a
// notice that says something untrue about it.
// ⚠ live and staging share this origin and therefore this allowance — they read and write the SAME
// keys, so there is one copy of the data, not two; the notice's remedies act on exactly that copy.
// (The other site cannot see a value this page is holding; it sees it once it is saved.)

// Is this the browser saying "no room"? Chromium/Safari name it QuotaExceededError (legacy code 22);
// older Firefox used NS_ERROR_DOM_QUOTA_REACHED (code 1014).

 * back. Neither can happen to a save that fit: it would simply have been replaced, or removed, by
 * what came after it. Dropping the held value makes a refused save behave exactly like that.
