// store/browsingSession.ts — is this boot a GENUINE cold open, or a reload inside the same session?
//
// ★ THE OWNER'S RULE, which this file is the whole mechanism for: "only truly closing the app starts
// fresh." A reload — the browser's own reload, the app's own auto-update reload, the Reload button on
// the error card — is the SAME browsing session, everywhere on the site: the page you were on stays,
// a finished round stays, and a guest's Amnesic preset stays Amnesic with its session stats.
//
// WHY A MARKER IS NEEDED AT ALL. Almost everything session-lived in this app is already right about
// reloads for free, because it lives in sessionStorage (store/sessionMode, store/sessionRound,
// store/sessionHistory, store/sessionGuide, an amnesic preset's session copy, the session Lookup
// overflow): a reload keeps sessionStorage and a real close clears it, and nothing has to notice
// either. The two things that have to know which it was are each preset's Amnesic value
// (store/sessionAmnesic — the session's own value on a reload, the preset's saved default on a fresh
// open, so guest mode ends with the guest) and the "Open in" pin (store/presets — a fresh open lands
// in the pinned preset, a reload stays where the player was), and neither can tell a reload from a
// cold open by itself: both boot the page from scratch.
// Round 21 treated every mount as a fresh open and called a reload "a reopen"; the owner reversed
// that.
// So the question is asked of sessionStorage itself: the marker below is written on the first boot of
// a session and survives every reload of it, so its ABSENCE is exactly "the browser started a new
// session" — the same fact everything else here already leans on, read from the same place.
//
// ⚠ A BROWSER THAT REFUSES sessionStorage answers "cold" every time. That is the consistent answer
// rather than a guess: in such a browser an amnesic preset's session was never written anywhere but
// memory, so a reload has ALREADY thrown the guest's session away — each preset back on its saved
// default is the only state that matches what is left.
// ⚠ ⚠ UNVERIFIABLE FROM HERE: that swiping the installed iOS app away clears its sessionStorage (the
// expected behaviour — a new process, a new browsing session). The owner checks it on his device.

// ⚠ index.html's pre-React boot script reads this key too (it has to resolve the preset a load opens
// in before any module exists — see browsingSessionOpen below); tests/bootTheme.dom runs that script
// against this file's marker, so the two spellings cannot drift.
