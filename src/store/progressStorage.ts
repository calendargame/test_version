// store/progressStorage.ts — HOW THE SAVED PROGRESS IS LAID OUT ON THE DEVICE, so that saving an
// answer costs the same however many solve times a player has.
//
// WHY. Every solve time is kept (store/progress), and the progress save is one key written whole on
// every answer — so a mode with 100,000 times re-wrote ~700 KB per answer. This file is the layer
// between zustand's persist and the storage area that makes the write small again.
//
// ★ THE LAYOUT. The main key keeps its name, its version and its exact shape. A mode ("silo") with
// more than SEAL_ABOVE times keeps only its newest 250–499 in the main key — the TAIL — and its
// older times live in CHUNK keys of exactly CHUNK_TIMES each, which are written once and never
// changed:
//
//     main   cg-progress-v1[~pN]              { …, times: [tail], timesLost: L + n, sealed: { n, ids } }
//     chunk  cg-times-v1[~pN]:<silo>:<j>.<id>  JSON array of the 250 times at positions j·250 …
//
//   • `sealed.ids[j]` names chunk j; `sealed.n` is how many times they hold (ids.length × 250).
//   • The sealed count is ADDED to the stored `timesLost`. That is what makes the layout readable by
//     every older build on this origin (live and staging share one copy of the data): to a build that
//     has never heard of chunks, sealed times look exactly like times the old 1,000 cap trimmed — a
//     state it already handles — and it carries `sealed` and `timesLost` through every write it
//     makes, because every Stats it builds is a spread of the one it read (or a reset, which drops
//     both together).
//   • A chunk's id is a hash of its text, so its NAME says what it holds: two pages that seal the
//     same times produce the same key, a crash between a chunk and the main save leaves a chunk the
//     next save finds and reuses, and no page can ever change what a name another page holds means.
//     A chunk key is written only when absent and is never overwritten.
//   • In memory nothing changes: the store holds every time in one array, `timesLost` is the real
//     legacy gap, and there is no `sealed`. This file adds them on the way out and removes them on
//     the way in.
//
// ★ THE MAIN KEY IS THE ONLY COMMIT POINT. Chunks go to the device first; the main key names a chunk
// only once it is there; anything not named by a main key is ignored by every reader. A chunk the
// device refuses is simply not sealed — those times stay in the tail, nothing is unsaved.
//
// ★ WHAT MAY DELETE A CHUNK — four cases, each by exact key name, and each bound to the storage AREA
// being written (an Amnesic preset's session copy lives in sessionStorage under the same names, and
// nothing here may reach across to the permanent one):
//   a. A RESET SEEN BY THIS PAGE: a silo this page last saved with times is now saved empty. The
//      chunk keys this page knew for it go, once that main save is on the device.
//   b. LEFT BEHIND, SEEN AT LOAD: a silo loads with no `sealed`, yet chunk keys exist for it (an
//      older build reset it, or saved a complete copy over a sealed one). The exact names found are
//      remembered, and at the next main save that lands each is deleted — UNLESS it still spells the
//      times at its position in what was just saved, which is the chunk a sealing save would name.
//   c. removeProgressCopy: the whole copy is going (a preset deleted, a guest session thrown away,
//      Full Reset's wipe of an Amnesic preset's parked stats).
//   d. sweepAbandonedTimes: once per fresh open — a preset that no longer exists and has no main key.
// Chunks that are merely unreachable — a deep Override re-sealed its part under new names, two tabs
// diverged — are KEPT until that silo is reset: an older page may still hold a save that names them.

// ── ★ A STAGED ROLLOUT, AND THE ONE TEMPORARY THING IN THIS FILE ──────────────────────────────
// This release is the READER. It loads a sealed save, and saves it back sealed — sealing forward as
// the tail grows, applying every rule above — but it NEVER STARTS sealing a silo that is not sealed
// already, so nothing it ships can create the layout. A save with no `sealed` in it is read and
// written exactly as before.
// WHAT TURNS IT ON: the NEXT release sets sealing on for every silo past SEAL_ABOVE times. By then
// every copy of the app on a device (the live site, the staging site, a tab left open) is at least
// this release, and so reads the layout in full.
// ⚠ THIS CONSTANT AND ITS BRANCH (`sealNewSilos ||` in the save below, and the parameter that
// carries it) ARE DELETED IN THAT RELEASE — sealing is then simply what a silo past the threshold
// does. Until then the tests run the save both ways.

// baseline and any sealed times included), never an increment on top of it; a silo that was NOT
// re-trimmed keeps whatever baseline it carries.
// ⚠ ONE THING IT CANNOT KNOW: whether some of that gap was answers given while timing was hidden
