// store/sessionRound.ts — an ENDED timed round/run, per (bests copy, mode), for THIS browsing session
// only.
//
// THE PROBLEM. A preset switch bumps every mode screen's remount key (src/main.tsx's
// remountScreens, fired from the registry subscription), unmounting and remounting the five
// always-mounted mode screens so their engine + component state re-hydrates from the INCOMING preset's
// stores — the mechanism that stops one preset's stats leaking into another (store/presetControl's
// switchPreset argues the "500-cards-becomes-4" bug in full). That remount is load-bearing and is
// NOT touched here. Its side effect, before this file, was that an ENDED Blitz round / MoX run — which
// used to survive a detour into another mode (BlitzMode/AoxMode only reset an ACTIVE round when
// hidden, never an ended one) — was thrown away by a preset ROUND-TRIP too. The owner wants an
// ended round to behave the same across a preset switch as across a mode detour: only a manual
// Reset or a full app close clears it.
//
// THE FIX, and why it does not go near the remount. Each of BlitzMode/AoxMode mirrors its ended
// round to sessionStorage here, keyed by the copy of the BESTS it was scored against and the mode,
// exactly as it already mirrors its Bests to store/progress. On mount (including the remount a switch
// causes) it reads the key for the copy NOW underneath it and, if an ended round is parked there,
// restores it as the engine's initial reducer state plus the handful of component fields the
// completed view needs.
//   ★★ KEYED BY THE BESTS COPY — store/amnesic's `activeBestsId`, "<presetId>:saved" (the
//     permanent Bests: Amnesic Off AND Stats Only) or "<presetId>:session" (Full) — NOT by the preset
//     alone. A parked round carries the Best records that stood before it and its round id, and the
//     mount that restores it REBUILDS its config's live record from them; so a round must only ever
//     come back over the Bests it was scored against. Keyed by preset alone, leaving Full restored
//     the GUEST'S round over the permanent Bests and rebuilt them from it — replacing, lowering or
//     erasing real bests (reproduced; tests/amnesicRound.dom) — and going to Full copied your round
//     into the fresh guest copy. Keyed by copy, both are unreachable by construction, the same
//     property that already stops one preset's round reaching another:
//       • a switch restores the incoming preset's own copy's round, never the one you just left;
//       • a change to or from Full restores the round of the copy that is now live: your own round,
//         hidden for the guest's interlude, comes back exactly as you left it (the owner's "within
//         one session everything comes back"), and the guest never sees it.
//     ★ AND ONE ROUND PER BESTS COPY, NOT PER AMNESIC VALUE, which is why Off and Stats Only share a
//     slot. The rebuild is only sound while the round is the ONE round that can have moved its record
//     since it began. Parked apart, an Off round would come back after a Stats Only round had beaten
//     the same permanent record, and rebuild that record from its own older starting point — taking
//     a saved Best away (store/amnesic's bestsIdOf; pinned in tests/amnesicRound.dom). Sharing the
//     slot means the finished round on screen simply stays on screen between Off and Stats Only.
//   • THE SESSION SLOT SHARES THE SESSION COPY'S LIFETIME. store/presetControl's setPresetAmnesic
//     discards a preset's session copy on every change of the value, so it discards that preset's
//     session-copy rounds in the same breath (discardSessionRoundsOf) — a guest round must not outlive
//     the guest Bests it was scored against, and a fresh guest start must not find the last guest's
//     round.
//   • ONLY ENDED rounds are parked. An in-progress round is never written, so a preset switch mid
//     round restores nothing and the round is discarded — the owner's requirement.
//   • sessionStorage, so a full app close clears the lot (the browser does it; nothing here
//     schedules a wipe) and a reload keeps it — the same lifetime store/amnesic and store/sessionMode
//     use, and the owner's rule that a reload is the SAME session (store/browsingSession).
//   • A manual Reset takes the round to idle, at which point the mode's mirror effect deletes the
//     key (discardSessionRound). Full Reset clears the preset's rounds itself, both copies', BEFORE
//     its remount (src/main.tsx — the remounted screens would otherwise read the parked blob back),
//     and discardSessionRounds does the same when a preset is deleted (store/presetControl's
//     clearPresetStorage).
//   • A screen that CRASHES drops the round parked for the copy it is on (src/main.tsx, through its
//     error boundary) — the crashed screen's own mirror effect is gone, and a round that broke its
//     screen once must not be restored into it again by the error card's Reload.
//   • A PARKED ROUND CARRIES THE CONFIGURATION IT WAS PLAYED UNDER, and the mode restores it only
//     over exactly that configuration (modes/BlitzMode's roundConfig, modes/AoxMode's RunConfig):
//     the settings are shared by every copy of a preset's numbers, so a guest can change them under a parked
//     round, and a round reconciled against settings it was never played on changed real bests.
//
// ONE JSON BLOB under one key, a map of "<bestsId>:<mode>" (e.g. "1:saved:blitz") → snapshot. The
// snapshot shape is the mode component's business (it round-trips its own engine state + flags); this
// module only reads and writes it and never inspects it. Every access is try/catch-wrapped —
// sessionStorage throws on the property access under locked-down browsing, and a round that cannot be
// parked is simply gone on the switch, which never breaks a render.
// ⚠ THE KEY IS `cg-round-v2`. v1 keyed "<presetId>:<mode>" and cannot say which copy a round was
// played on — which is the very fact whose absence was the bug — so a v1 blob is not read at all
// rather than guessed at. The cost is bounded and one-off: an ended round on screen at the moment the
// update reload lands is not restored (its Bests were saved when it ended). The v1 blob is not
// deleted either: the other site on this shared origin may still be an older build using it, and the
// browser drops it at the session's end anyway.
