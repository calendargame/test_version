// settings.js — the ⚙ Settings store (Stage C, Steps 5a + 5b).
//
// Holds the 16 values that live in the Settings popover (13 at the Stage-C extraction; the Input
// style was added Session 10, the Rotate Dots setting in batch group 3, `defaultMode` in
// Round 21). Originally these were useState hooks inside App; centralizing them
// is the structural groundwork
// for (a) saved-progress and (b) splitting the fused game modes apart later,
// since the modes can read settings from here instead of receiving them all as
// threaded props.
//
// Step 5b — PERSISTENCE: the store is wrapped in Zustand's `persist` middleware,
// so the 16 settings save to the device (localStorage key 'cg-settings-v1') and
// restore on reload. Only the data values are persisted (partialize strips the
// setter functions); Zustand merges the saved values over the fresh store on
// load, so the setters always come from the live code, never from storage. The
// versioned key lets us migrate cleanly if the settings shape ever changes.
//
// DROP-IN CONTRACT: each setter accepts EITHER a direct value OR a functional
// updater (prev => next) — exactly like a React useState setter — so the call
// sites in App that do setUseJulian(v=>!v) keep working verbatim. App binds the
// store fields/setters to the SAME local names it used before, so the ~200 read
// sites and the big settingsAtDefaults / isFullyReset boolean expressions are
// untouched.
//
// NOT in this store (intentionally): minInputVal / maxInputVal — those are
// transient text-input mirror strings, not persisted settings; they stay as
// local useState in App.

// The day-of-week answer input layout: the classic labelled buttons, or the logo's 7-dot grid
// (Settings → Input). Stored as an enum (not a boolean) so more layouts can be added later.

// Save Defaults (SavedDefaults.settings is a full SettingsValues snapshot, so it rides along with
// no extra wiring) and restored by Reset Settings / Full Reset. It only takes EFFECT on a cold
// open or a preset switch — main.tsx reads it then via readStoredDefaultMode below and calls
// switchMode; nothing else consults it. The app-global "open in which preset" pin is a SEPARATE

//     SETTINGS_DEFAULTS) would never re-persist them anyway.
//   • A valid `dotRotation` already present WINS over any legacy field — a payload this build
//     wrote and an older build then re-saved while keeping the unknown field (store/userDefaults'

//     only be a second statement of the default.
//   • ⚠ AN UNRECOGNISED `dotRotation` IS DROPPED too, and that is this build being the OLDER build
//     for once: a future build that adds a fourth rotation will bump `version`, and zustand runs

      //   • AN OLDER BUILD WRITES, THIS ONE READS: its payload carries `rotateDots` (or, older
      //     still, `dotOrientation`) under its OWN older `version`, so this build's `migrate` below
      //     catches it on the next boot here, and a turned layout comes back as 90° — the only turn
      //     those builds knew. A build from before the setting existed writes neither field, and
      //     that boot reads the factory Standard.
      //   • THIS BUILD WRITES, AN OLDER ONE READS (`dotRotation`, version 4): the older build finds
      //     no `rotateDots` and draws its factory UPRIGHT layout — FAIL-SAFE, never a wrong turn and
      //     never a crash, because it ignores the unknown field outright. But zustand runs that
      //     build's `migrate` on the version mismatch and then RE-SAVES at once through its own
      //     `partialize`, which drops `dotRotation`; so after an older build has merely OPENED, this
      //     build reads the player's choice back as Standard. Bounded (one setting reverts; nothing
      //     is mis-attributed, no stats are involved) and reachable only from a pre-round-23 tab
      //     still open on the same origin. A legacy `rotateDots` mirror written beside `dotRotation`
