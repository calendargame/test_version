// store/presets.ts — THE PRESET REGISTRY, and the storage layer every per-preset store sits on.
//
// WHAT A PRESET IS. Several independent copies of the app on one device, csTimer-style: each preset
// carries its OWN stats, bests, ⚙ settings, mode setup, saved personal defaults — and its own THEME
// (the owner was explicit that nothing, not even the theme, stays global). Switching preset is
// switching apps.
//
// ★★ THE ONE DECISION EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWS FROM: THERE IS NO MIGRATION. Preset 1 does not
// RECEIVE the existing saved data — preset 1 *IS* the existing saved data. Its four stores keep the
// exact localStorage keys they have always had, byte for byte, and only presets 2, 3, 4… get
// namespaced ones. `presetKey` below is written so that this is an IDENTITY rather than a special
// case: the key for preset 1 is the base key with nothing appended.
//   → WHAT THAT DELETES, rather than manages: the copy step, the half-finished copy, the run-twice
//     data loss, the doubled storage, and the clean-up pass that would have had to follow.
//   → ⚠ WHY IT MATTERS *HERE* SPECIFICALLY, and this is not theoretical. The live site and the
//     staging site are THE SAME BROWSER ORIGIN, and preset builds reach staging first, so an old
//     build and a new build genuinely interleave on one set of keys. A copy-into-preset-1 migration
//     was reproduced losing 20 cards silently on exactly that interleaving. With "preset 1 IS the
//     data", a build that has never heard of presets and a build that has agree about preset 1 BY
//     CONSTRUCTION — because the un-namespaced keys are the only thing "your data" could possibly
//     mean to a build that has never heard of presets.
//     ⚠ WHAT "AGREE" MEANS, EXACTLY, because it is stronger about the KEYS than about the BYTES.
//     The keys are identical, so neither build can ever read or write the other's preset — that is
//     the loss this design deletes, and it is absolute. The PAYLOAD is a weaker promise, and it is
//     each store's own `partialize` that weakens it: an old build writes back only the fields it
//     knows, so any field a NEWER build added is dropped from the shared key the next time the old
//     build saves, and the new build then reads that field as its factory value. It is bounded
//     (one setting reverts; nothing is mis-attributed and no stats are lost) and it is inherent to
//     two builds sharing one key rather than a fault of this scheme — a copy migration would have
//     had the same interleaving with data loss on top. Today's instance is store/settings'
//     `dotRotation` (the Rotate Dots setting, added after this design shipped as `dotOrientation`,
//     then `rotateDots` in round 20, then three-way in round 23); the note, including the one
//     direction a `migrate` step recovers instead of reverting, is at that store's `name` option.
//
// WHAT LIVES IN THIS FILE, and why they live together:
//   • the REGISTRY store — the list of presets and which one is active. It is GLOBAL: it is the
//     thing that says which preset you are on, so it cannot itself live inside a preset.
//   • the KEY MATH (`presetKey`) and the SCOPED STORAGE ADAPTER the four per-preset stores persist
//     through. The adapter reads the registry, so keeping both here means the dependency is one
//     way and inside one file rather than a cycle across two.
//   • `mergeOverDefaults`, the hydration rule that makes a switch safe (argued at its definition).
// What does NOT live here: anything that CHANGES which preset you are on. That is store/presetControl
// — because switching is not a registry edit, it is a registry edit plus four rehydrations plus a
// screen remount, and splitting it out is what stops a caller from doing only the first third.

// ── The keys a preset is made of ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ★ THE FOUR BASE KEYS LIVE HERE, not in the four store files, and that is deliberate: DELETING a
// preset has to remove exactly its keys and nothing else, which is only checkable if something can
// enumerate them. Enumerating them by scanning localStorage for a pattern would be the fragile
// version (it would sweep up anything that happened to match); deriving them from this record is
// exact, and a fifth per-preset store added later becomes deletable by the act of being listed.
// ⚠ The `-v1` in these strings is the ORIGINAL key version and is frozen history — the live shape
// version is each store's own `version` option. Do not "tidy" them.

// ★★ HOW LONG A PRESET NAME MAY BE — round 20 CHANGED WHAT THIS NUMBER IS FOR, and that is
// worth stating before the number itself. It used to be DERIVED, pinned exactly to the switcher's
// then-FIXED display cell (6em at text-sm, ≈12 characters) so that a typed name could never
// truncate under ordinary conditions. Round 20 made that cell FLEXIBLE — it now grows with the top bar
// (components/PresetSwitcher's PRESET_NAME_COL is a MINIMUM width today, not a fixed one) — and
// put a LIVE, PIXEL-MEASURED cap on the one place a name is actually typed (the rename field,
// components/PresetManager, measured against the switcher's own current rendered width — see
// lib/presetNameWidth for the mechanism). That live cap is what answers "how many characters fit
// right now", and it is a moving target by construction: the same name that fits a wide phone can
// overflow a narrow one, and this constant cannot chase a number that changes per device.
//
// ★ SO THIS CONSTANT'S JOB NARROWED TO ONE THING: screening a name this app did NOT just watch get
// typed — one that arrived from localStorage (an older build, a smaller-cap build, a tampered or
// truncated payload) or cross-device sync, none of which ever passed through the live typing UI at
// all. `normalizePresetName` is the enforcement point (it slices on every read, not only on typed
// input), and it needs SOME hard ceiling independent of any measurement, because there is no live
// switcher cell to measure against a value that is being loaded, only one it is about to be shown
// in.
// ⚠ SO IT IS DELIBERATELY MORE GENEROUS THAN ANY SINGLE DEVICE'S TYPING CAP, not equal to it. The
// switcher's widest realistic budget — the top bar's own max-w-[30rem] (480px) container, at the
// fluid root's largest size — comes out to roughly 25 characters of headroom by the same em-based
// arithmetic PRESET_NAME_COL used to use (fixed chrome ~230px of a ~442px content box at the
// clamp's tall-and-wide end, leaving ~212px ÷ ~8.3px/char ≈ 25). 40 clears that with real margin —
// enough that a name honestly typed against a generous device's live cap is never retroactively
// shortened here — while still being a firm, bounded ceiling against a payload nobody typed: it
// caps storage size and render cost the same way the old 12 did, just at a number chosen for what
// this screen is FOR now rather than for a pixel budget it no longer owns.
// ⚠ LOWERING IT IS RETROACTIVE, BY DESIGN, UNCHANGED FROM BEFORE. normalizePresetName slices on
// every read, so a name saved under an older, longer cap is shortened the next time the registry
// hydrates rather than being kept as a value this screen decided it would rather not trust. That

// device does not even gain a `cg-presets-v1` entry — persist only writes on a set, and hydrating

//
// ★ THE NAMESPACING MECHANISM, and the alternative it beat. The obvious implementation is to swap
// each store's persist `name` when the active preset changes (`persist.setOptions({ name })`). It
// was rejected:
//   • it needs FOUR key rewrites at every switch, each of which is a chance to miss a store, and a
//     missed store is silent — that store simply keeps writing into the preset you just left;
//   • it leaves the key composition duplicated at four call sites;
//   • worst, it opens a window. Between "name swapped" and "state rehydrated" the store holds the
//     OLD preset's values pointed at the NEW preset's key, and any write in that window overwrites
//     real data with the wrong preset's.
// Instead the `name` NEVER changes — it stays the base key, forever, in the store file where it has
// always been — and this adapter rewrites it to the active preset's key at the moment of each read
// and each write. There is no window at all: the swap IS the registry write, and the very next
// storage call already goes to the new preset.
//
// ⚠ WHAT HAPPENS TO A STORE THAT IS ALREADY MOUNTED WHEN THE ACTIVE PRESET CHANGES — the question
// this design has to answer out loud. Its `name` is unaffected, so its next WRITE lands in the new
// preset automatically; but its in-memory state is still the OLD preset's until something reloads
// it. That is why presetControl.switchPreset rehydrates all four synchronously in the same tick
// (nothing can write in between — this is one JS turn), and why src/main.tsx SUBSCRIBES to the
// registry below and remounts the five always-mounted mode screens whenever `activeId` changes: those
// screens hold gameplay state of their own that no store reload can reach, and without the remount
// the next answered question writes the old preset's stats into the new preset. That was PROVEN
// against the real stores: a device with 500 cards ended up with 4.
//
// ⚠ ORDERING: this adapter asks the registry for `activeId` on every call, so the registry must
// exist before any per-preset store hydrates. It does, and by construction rather than by luck —
// every per-preset store imports this module, so ESM finishes evaluating this file (registry
// included, hydrated synchronously from localStorage) before that store's `create` runs.
//
// ⚠ PRIVATE MODE: `window.localStorage` is read EAGERLY, inside the factory, so that a browser
// which throws on the property access throws where zustand's createJSONStorage catches it — which
// returns `undefined` and puts the store on persist's in-memory-only path. Building the object
// lazily instead would let the throw escape into every getItem/setItem, i.e. into hydration and
// into every setState. This mirrors zustand's own default storage exactly; it is why the app
// survives locked-down browsing today, and it must keep doing so.

      // notice instead of a throw out of the store's setter, and is held for THIS preset's key — so

      // land here.

// ── The hydration rule that makes switching safe ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ★ HYDRATION REPLACES THE SAVED DATA; IT DOES NOT PATCH IT OVER WHATEVER IS IN MEMORY. Zustand's
// default merge is `{...current, ...persisted}`, which is correct exactly once — at a cold start,
// where `current` IS the factory defaults. On a PRESET SWITCH the same expression is a data leak:
// `current` is the preset you just left, `persisted` is the preset you just opened, and every key
// the new preset has not saved yet quietly inherits the old preset's value. A brand-new preset —
// which decision 3 says starts from FACTORY DEFAULTS — would open holding a copy of the preset you
// came from, and its first write would make that copy permanent.
//
// So the defaults go in the middle, unconditionally: current (for the actions) → factory values →
// the saved copy. At a cold start this is byte-identical to the default merge, because `current`
// already equals the factory values; at a switch it is the difference between a fresh preset and a
// clone. It also closes a smaller pre-existing hole on the same line: a `persist.rehydrate()` on a
// live store used to keep in-memory values for any key the payload lacked.
//
// ⚠ The persisted half is spread LAST and unscreened, exactly as before — any store that still
// needs to validate untrusted entries on every load (store/lookupHistory's own normalisation) owns
// that screen itself, in its own `merge`, rather than this shared helper trying to know about it.
