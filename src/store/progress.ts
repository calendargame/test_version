// store/progress.ts — saved gameplay progress (Stage D1).
//
// The sibling of the settings store: where everything that should SURVIVE a reload
// lives, persisted to the device. Modeled exactly on settings.ts (same persist
// middleware, same functional-updater setters, same partialize-strips-setters,
// same factory-defaults-reused-by-reset). localStorage key 'cg-progress-v1'.
//
// WHAT PERSISTS (agreed Stage-D scope):
//   • Lifetime stats for the continuous modes — Classic, Flash, and Deduction's
//     three sub-modes (Day/Month/Year). Each is the engine's Stats object.
//   • All-time bests, config-keyed — Blitz per-round (score/streak), per-question
//     sudden death (score only), per-question with Allow Mistakes (score/streak),
//     and AoX (average/median). These already lived as component state; the store
//     now owns them (and their types).
//
// WHAT DOES *NOT* PERSIST (intentionally — mid-run/round state is discarded):
//   • The engine's live question, history stacks, locked/revealed flags, etc. — never HERE. (A
//     casual mode's are kept for the browsing session, in sessionStorage: store/sessionHistory. A
//     real close still discards them.)
//   • AoX/Blitz engine stats — those are per-run/round scores, not lifetime totals;
//     only their bests above persist. (An ENDED round or run is kept for the browsing session:
//     store/sessionRound.)
//   • The "new best ★" markers — nothing is stored for them at all: each is read off the round id
//     saved inside the Best record (engine/roundId's isNewBest).
//
// ⚠ LOOKUP HISTORY USED TO LIVE HERE AND NO LONGER DOES (round 20) — it moved to its own
// store/lookupHistory, because it stopped being PRESET data: it is now one shared list read by
// every preset, not one of the four things a preset switch swaps out. See that file's header for
// the full argument. Its old field on THIS store's persisted payload is handled at the bottom of
// this file's `persist` options (the version bump, and why no `migrate` step is needed for it).
//
// ★ EVERY SOLVE TIME IS KEPT, so Mean and Median are all-time numbers and a reload
// shows exactly what the screen showed before it. This store used to keep only the newest 1,000
// saved times while `good` kept counting — which made the "Enable and Reset Stats?" check fire after
// every reload for anyone past 1,000 timed answers, and made a reloaded Mean average a different
// set of solves than the in-visit one. The size that cap was guarding is small once the times are
// short (engine/stats' 0.1 ms grid, ~7 bytes each: ~0.5 MB per mode for 200 answers a day for a
// year), and a save the device refuses to take is reported to the player (store/storageHealth)
// rather than lost in silence. Saves the old cap already trimmed are repaired as they are read
// (store/progressStorage's baselineTrimmedTimes) — and that file is also what keeps the save of a
// long history small: the store holds every time in one array, the device holds the older ones in
// sealed chunks.

// All-time best shapes (config-keyed). Moved here from main.tsx so the persisted store
// is the single owner; the mode components import these back.

// ── v4 → v5: A BEST RECORD THAT SAYS NOTHING IS NOT A RECORD ─────────────────
//
// Every Best map holds a key ONLY for a configuration that has a record (engine/bestMap). Builds up
// to v2.26.0 broke that in one corner: a round or run that set a config's FIRST record and was then
// overridden back below it left the key behind, holding a record of nothing — a MoX record with no
// mean and no median, a Blitz record with a score and streak of 0. On screen it reads as "no record"
// (MoX) or as a Best of 0 nobody earned (Blitz); underneath, it is a key — so Full Reset stayed lit
// with nothing left to reset, and deleting the preset asked about data that was not there.
// Those records are dropped here, where the save crosses into this build's shape, and from then on
// neither door lets one in: no write files one (fileBest takes the key away instead), and no load
// keeps one.
// ⚠ IN THE VERSION-GATED STEP, NOT ON EVERY LOAD, and the shared origin is why that is enough: an
// older build stamps everything it writes with ITS version (it even re-stamps a newer save the
// moment it loads one), so a record like this can only ever arrive inside a pre-v5 payload — which
// is exactly what runs this step, again, every time it happens. It is also the step
// store/presetControl's isPresetFactory judges a preset you are not on through, so a preset whose
// only "data" is one of these reads as untouched without being opened.
// ⚠ ONLY THE EXACT EMPTY SHAPES. Anything else under a Best key — a real record, or something this
// build cannot name — is left exactly as it was found.
// The older build that may still be open on this origin is not harmed: to it a missing key and one
// of these records read the same (it falls back to the same empty record for both).
// Exported for tests.
