// store/progress.ts — saved gameplay progress (Stage D1).
//
// The sibling of the settings store: where everything that should SURVIVE a reload
// lives, persisted to the device. Modeled exactly on settings.ts (same persist
// middleware, same functional-updater setters, same partialize-strips-setters,
// same factory-defaults-reused-by-reset). localStorage key 'cg-progress-v1'.
//
// WHAT PERSISTS (agreed Stage-D scope):
//   • Lifetime stats for the continuous modes — Classic, Flash, and Deduction's
//     three sub-modes (Day/Month/Year). Each is the engine's Stats object.
//   • All-time bests, config-keyed — Blitz per-round (score/streak), per-question
//     sudden death (score only), per-question with Allow Mistakes (score/streak, C3a),
//     and AoX (average/median). These already lived as component state; the store
//     now owns them (and their types).
//   • Lookup history (the newest LOOKUP_HISTORY_CAP lookups — see addLookupEntry below) — see
//     LookupEntry below: the INPUTS only, never the rendered text (that is derived at paint time
//     from the live settings).
//
// WHAT DOES *NOT* PERSIST (intentionally — mid-run/round state is discarded):
//   • The engine's live question, history stacks, locked/revealed flags, etc.
//   • Blitz/AoX engine stats — those are per-round/run scores, not lifetime totals;
//     only their bests above persist.
//   • The "new best ★" markers and the override-rollback refs — ephemeral per-session
//     UI state; they stay as local state in the mode components.
//
// Solve-`times` arrays are capped to a rolling window in setModeStats (below) so the
// persisted payload can't grow without bound across sessions.

// All-time best shapes (config-keyed). Moved here from main.tsx so the persisted store
// is the single owner; the mode components import these back.

// The lookup-history normalizer, and the ONLY thing that decides what shape a stored entry has.
//
// SHAPE (v3): an entry is {id, y, m, d, isGap?} and nothing else. It used to also carry three
// RENDERED fields (label/weekday/result) — snapshots of how the date read at lookup time, so after
// a Date Format change the result sentence on screen disagreed with the history row right below
// it. LookupCard derives all three now, which makes the stored copies not just redundant but
// wrong, so this drops them. Lossless: y/m/d have been on the entry since the app's first commit
// in this repo, long before the persist store existed (Stage D1).
//
// VALIDATION: the filter asserts exactly what the consumers dereference. LookupCard carries no
// per-field guards of its own any more — the store owns the shape, so the store has to guarantee
// it, or a truncated/tampered payload reaches the card as {id} alone and renders MONTH[NaN] and a
// blank weekday, or trips the mode error boundary. An entry that can't answer "which date?" has
// nothing to show and is dropped.
//
// The date must also be a REAL one, not merely a number-shaped one. This is the same either-calendar
// rule Lookup validates with (dimEither): a date counts if it exists in a calendar it can be read
// in, so pre-reform February keeps Julian's 29th, and February 30 or day 32 exists nowhere and is
// dropped. Without this check a tampered or truncated payload would be ANSWERED rather than refused
// — the card would print a confident weekday for a date that never happened, since the underlying
// day-number arithmetic happily rolls February 30 into March. Whole numbers for the same reason:
// month 1.5 indexes MONTH to `undefined` and day 1.5 produces a weekday belonging to no day.
// Deliberately NOT bounded to Lookup's 1–10000 years: an out-of-range year still names a real date
// and still reads correctly, so there is nothing wrong to drop — unlike an impossible day, which
// can only be answered wrongly.
//
// This runs on EVERY rehydrate (see `merge` below), not just the v2→v3 upgrade: a v3 payload is
// read from the same untrusted localStorage as a v2 one. Exported for tests.
