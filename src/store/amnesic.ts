// store/amnesic.ts — AMNESIC PRESETS: a preset whose stats are never written down.
//
// WHAT IT IS, in the owner's words: a guest mode. Hand the phone over, they play, they close it,
// nothing is kept. The mechanism is deliberately the dullest one available — while a preset is
// amnesic its STATS live in sessionStorage instead of localStorage, so the browser throws them away
// when the app is closed and this app never has to notice that it happened. ★ NOTHING HERE DETECTS
// A CLOSE, and nothing here schedules a wipe. There is no "clear on exit" hook to miss-fire, no
// beforeunload that iOS declines to deliver, no timer racing a suspend. The data is simply never
// written to permanent storage, which is the only version of this promise a browser can keep.
//
// ⚠⚠ AND THAT IS ALSO WHY THE PROMISE HAS TO BE STATED HONESTLY TO THE PLAYER, which the
// How-to-Play section does out loud: on iOS an app the SYSTEM evicts from the background is
// indistinguishable from one you closed yourself. Both end the browsing session; both take the
// stats with them. Anything that said "only when you close it" would be a lie no web app can make
// true, and the owner accepted that in writing rather than have it hidden.
//
// ── WHERE THE FLAG LIVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT A ⚙ SETTING ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The switch is drawn in the ⚙ panel directly under Save Stats, but the VALUE lives on the preset
// itself (store/presets' `Preset.amnesic`, in the global registry). Three reasons, and the first is
// the one that would have caused a data-loss bug:
//   ★★ A ⚙ SETTING CAN BE WRITTEN BY applySettings. Reset Settings and Full Reset both push a whole
//      16-value snapshot through it in one `set`. If amnesic were one of those values, either
//      button could flip it from ON to OFF with no rehydration and no screen remount — the five
//      always-mounted mode screens would keep holding the session's numbers while the store was
//      repointed at the parked permanent ones, and the next answered question would write the
//      session's stats over the player's real ones. That is the exact shape of the 500-cards-
//      becomes-4 failure store/presetControl was built to make unwritable. Living on the preset
//      puts every write to it behind `applyRegistry`, which is the one door that already carries
//      the remount (src/main.tsx subscribes to it).
//   • A preset UI has to show a small "A" indicator for presets you are NOT currently on. The
//     registry is global and holds every preset; a per-preset settings payload can only answer for
//     the ACTIVE one without hand-parsing other presets' localStorage.
//   • It is simply what the flag IS. The owner's own split says "KEEPS: every setting … and the
//     amnesic flag itself" — the flag is named SEPARATELY from the settings, because it is a
//     property of the preset in the same way its name is.
//
// ⚠ An older build reading a registry that says `amnesic: true` ignores the field entirely and
// reads the permanent stats — which are exactly the parked ones, untouched. Nothing it can show is
// wrong; it just cannot see the session. That is the honest degradation, and it comes for free.

// ── WHAT AN AMNESIC PRESET FORGETS, AS ONE DECLARATIVE LIST ───────────────────────────────────
//
// ★★ THIS LIST IS THE FEATURE'S DEFINITION, and it is a LIST rather than a wipe path on purpose.
// The owner called the all-time bests his softest call — "I can always come back later and revert
// it if I change my mind" — so the cost of changing his mind has to be deleting a line from here,
// not auditing branches spread through a clearing routine. Everything below reads this list; there
// is no second place that knows what amnesic forgets.
//
// CLEARS (this list) — score, accuracy, streak and the solve times (`stats`, the five lifetime
// silos); and the ALL-TIME BESTS (blitzBest, suddenBest, suddenAmBest, aoxBest). The browsable
// question history is not named because it is not part of the saved progress: it is engine state
// inside the always-mounted mode screens, kept for the browsing session only and per stats copy
// (store/sessionHistory) — a guest's history lives and dies with the guest's session copy, and your
// own comes back with your own stats when the guest is done.
//
// KEEPS (everything not named here) — which is, today, the whole of the other three per-preset
// stores: every ⚙ setting including theme, the per-mode setup, and the saved personal defaults.
// They are kept by CONSTRUCTION rather than by an exclusion list: this file only ever repoints the
// PROGRESS store, so the other three cannot be reached from here at all. The split is STATS, NOT
// CONFIGURATION — an amnesic preset stays itself across a close and only forgets how you did.
//
// ⚠ LOOKUP HISTORY USED TO BE A THIRD CLEARS ENTRY AND NO LONGER CAN BE (round 20) — it left
// store/progress entirely (see store/lookupHistory), which means it left what THIS LIST is even
// capable of describing: `keyof ProgressValues` cannot name a field that is not part of
// ProgressValues, so leaving it here would have failed to compile the moment the move landed. That
// compile error is a feature, not a casualty — read it as confirmation the type guard below is
// doing its job, not as something to work around. Removing it from this list does NOT mean an
// amnesic session's lookups now join the permanent shared history: they still don't, and still
// can't. store/lookupHistory grew its OWN suppression for exactly this — a session-only bucket a
// new entry goes into instead of the permanent one, decided by the same `selectAmnesic` check this
// file exports, at the moment main.tsx pushes the entry — because a SHARED, non-preset-scoped list
// cannot be "cleared" by repointing one preset's storage the way this file repoints PROGRESS: there
// is no preset-scoped copy of it to repoint away from in the first place.
//
// ⚠ TYPED AS `keyof ProgressValues`, which is the half a comment cannot enforce: renaming a
// persisted progress key without updating this list is a compile error rather than a silently
// remembered stat. (The import is type-only, so store/progress can import this file back for its
// storage adapter without a runtime cycle.)

// session copy yet — the first read after the switch is flipped, and every read after the app is
// re-opened — starts from the PARKED permanent payload with the cleared keys REMOVED. The keys

// would be a write inside a getItem, which hydration calls — and the moment this function writes,
// the question "can an amnesic session ever touch storage it should not" stops having a one-line
// answer. The next setItem creates the session copy; until then every read re-derives, which costs
// one JSON parse on a payload that is already in memory.
//
// A parked payload that will not parse seeds NOTHING (null): a truncated or tampered envelope
// cannot be trusted to say which stats are whose, and handing it to the session would launder it.
// The player sees a fresh session, which is the correct answer for a corrupt permanent copy too.

// run while the flag is on. tests/amnesic.dom asserts it as a byte comparison rather than as a
// behaviour, because a behaviour test would only prove the paths somebody thought to drive.
//
// ⚠⚠ MERGING A SESSION BACK INTO THE PERMANENT STATS ON TOGGLE-OFF IS BANNED, and it is banned by
// there being nowhere to write it FROM: the session copy is discarded before the store rehydrates,
// so by the time anything permanent is read again the session's numbers no longer exist. A merge is
// exactly the 500-cards-becomes-4 shape — two sets of stats, one of them stale, one write picking
// the wrong one — and the owner ruled it out. Toggling OFF discards; it never reconciles.

// boolean in front of the sentence above.
// ★ IT ONLY CHOOSES THE COPY. How a copy is laid out on the device — the main key, and the sealed
// chunks a long history of solve times is kept in — is store/progressStorage's, which is handed
