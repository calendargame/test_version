// store/amnesic.ts — AMNESIC PRESETS: a preset whose stats (and, on Full, whose bests) are never
// written down.
//
// WHAT IT IS, in the owner's words: a guest mode. Hand the phone over, they play, they close it,
// nothing is kept. The mechanism is deliberately the dullest one available — what an amnesic preset
// forgets lives in sessionStorage instead of localStorage, so the browser throws it away when the app
// is closed and this app never has to notice that it happened. ★ NOTHING HERE DETECTS A CLOSE, and
// nothing here schedules a wipe. There is no "clear on exit" hook to miss-fire, no beforeunload that
// iOS declines to deliver, no timer racing a suspend. The data is simply never written to permanent
// storage, which is the only version of this promise a browser can keep.
//
// ⚠⚠ AND THAT IS ALSO WHY THE PROMISE HAS TO BE STATED HONESTLY TO THE PLAYER, which the
// How-to-Play section does out loud: on iOS an app the SYSTEM evicts from the background is
// indistinguishable from one you closed yourself. Both end the browsing session; both take the
// session's numbers with them. Anything that said "only when you close it" would be a lie no web app
// can make true, and the owner accepted that in writing rather than have it hidden.
//
// ── THE THREE VALUES (store/amnesicMode) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   Off        — everything is saved.
//   Stats Only — the STATS are the session's; the round modes' BESTS are the permanent ones. "I can
//                mess around and not worry about my score but I can still store a new best."
//   Full       — stats and bests are both the session's. The guest mode above.
//
// ── WHERE THE VALUE LIVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT A ⚙ SETTING ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// The pill is drawn in the ⚙ panel directly under Save Stats, but the VALUE is not one of the ⚙
// settings: it is held per preset for the browsing session (store/sessionAmnesic), and what a preset
// starts a fresh open on is the value in its saved defaults. Two reasons it cannot be a settings
// value, and the first is the one that would have caused a data-loss bug:
//   ★★ A ⚙ SETTING CAN BE WRITTEN BY applySettings. Reset Settings and Full Reset both push a whole
//      16-value snapshot through it in one `set`. If the Amnesic value were one of those, either
//      button could change it with no rehydration and no screen remount — the five always-mounted
//      mode screens would keep holding the session's numbers while the store was repointed at the
//      parked permanent ones, and the next answered question would write the session's stats over
//      the player's real ones. That is the exact shape of the 500-cards-becomes-4 failure
//      store/presetControl was built to make unwritable. Every change to the value goes through
//      store/presetControl's setPresetAmnesic instead, which pairs it with the discard, the reload
//      and the remount (src/main.tsx subscribes to activeDataId below).
//   • A preset list has to say which presets are amnesic for presets you are NOT currently on (the
//     spoken ", amnesic" in components/PresetSwitcher). A per-preset settings payload can only answer
//     for the ACTIVE one without hand-parsing other presets' localStorage.
//
// ⚠ An older build on this origin knows nothing of the session's value. It reads its own flag on the
// preset registry and the permanent stats — which are exactly the parked ones, untouched. Nothing it
// can show is wrong; it just cannot see the session. (What it reads where, and the one sequence that
// is left open, is argued in store/sessionAmnesic and store/amnesicMode.)

// ── WHAT AN AMNESIC PRESET FORGETS, AS ONE DECLARATIVE LIST ───────────────────────────────────
//
// ★★ THIS LIST IS THE FEATURE'S DEFINITION, and it is a LIST rather than a wipe path on purpose.
// Everything below reads it; there is no second place that knows what each value forgets.
//
// CLEARS (the session's, per value) —
//   Stats Only: `stats` — score, accuracy, streak (the best-streak figure included) and the solve
//     times of the five lifetime silos, i.e. the whole of the casual modes' stats strip.
//   Full: those, and the ALL-TIME BESTS (blitzBest, suddenBest, suddenAmBest, aoxBest).
// The browsable question history is not named because it is not part of the saved progress: it is
// engine state inside the always-mounted mode screens, kept for the browsing session only and per
// stats copy (store/sessionHistory) — a guest's history lives and dies with the guest's session copy,
// and your own comes back with your own stats when the guest is done. Nor are a Blitz round's or a
// MoX run's own running numbers (score, accuracy, streak, Last, Mean, Median): those are the round's,
// never saved by any value — only the Bests a round sets are.
//
// KEEPS (everything not named) — under Stats Only the four Best maps, which stay in the PERMANENT
// copy: read from it, and written back to it the moment a round sets one. And, under every value, the
// whole of the other three per-preset stores: every ⚙ setting including theme, the per-mode setup,
// and the saved personal defaults. Those are kept by CONSTRUCTION rather than by an exclusion list:
// this file only ever repoints the PROGRESS store, so the other three cannot be reached from here at
// all. The split is STATS, NOT CONFIGURATION — an amnesic preset stays itself across a close and only
// forgets how you did.
//
// ⚠ LOOKUP HISTORY IS NOT IN THIS LIST AND CANNOT BE — it left store/progress (see
// store/lookupHistory), so `keyof ProgressValues` cannot name it. It has its OWN rule, decided by the
// same value at the moment src/main.tsx pushes an entry (keepsLookups below): saved normally under Off
// and Stats Only (a lookup is not a stat), and held in a session-only bucket under Full — because a
// SHARED, non-preset-scoped list cannot be "cleared" by repointing one preset's storage the way this
// file repoints PROGRESS.
//
// ⚠ TYPED AS `keyof ProgressValues`, which is the half a comment cannot enforce: renaming a
// persisted progress key without updating this list is a compile error rather than a silently
// remembered stat. (The import is type-only, so store/progress can import this file back for its
// storage adapter without a runtime cycle.)
// …and it is a RECORD over every key, so a progress key added later that is not sorted here fails to
// compile, instead of becoming something a guest's session quietly keeps.

// ── Where an amnesic preset's saved progress actually reads and writes ────────────────────────
//
// ★★ THE INVARIANT, IN ONE SENTENCE: WHILE A PRESET IS AMNESIC, NOTHING WRITES ITS PERMANENT STATS,
// AND THE ONLY THING WRITTEN TO ITS PERMANENT COPY AT ALL IS A BEST MAP IT KEEPS. It is true because
// the storage below has exactly two places that name `ls` for a write — the whole-copy save, which
// cannot run while the value is anything but Off, and writeKept, which builds what it writes from the
// permanent text as it stands plus the kept maps and nothing else: it is never handed the stats.
// tests/amnesic.dom asserts it as a byte comparison rather than as a behaviour, because a behaviour
// test would only prove the paths somebody thought to drive.
//
// ⚠⚠ MERGING A SESSION BACK INTO THE PERMANENT STATS IS BANNED, and it is banned by there being
// nowhere to write it FROM: the session copy is discarded on every change of the value before the
// store rehydrates, so by the time anything permanent is read again the session's numbers no longer
// exist. A merge is exactly the 500-cards-becomes-4 shape — two sets of stats, one of them stale, one
// write picking the wrong one — and the owner ruled it out. Changing the value discards; it never
// reconciles.
//
// This is store/presets' presetScopedStorage with ONE extra question asked per call — WHICH COPY, per
// key — and it stays a SECOND named adapter rather than an option on the first: the first is the rule
// for the three stores that are always permanent, and an adapter that could be either would put a
// condition in front of the sentence above.
// ★ IT ONLY CHOOSES THE COPY. How a copy is laid out on the device — the main key, and the sealed
// chunks a long history of solve times is kept in — is store/progressStorage's, which is handed
// exactly one (area, preset) per call and can therefore reach no other: while a preset is amnesic
// nothing there reads, lists or deletes a single chunk of its permanent copy. The kept Best maps are
// read from and written into the permanent MAIN key's text directly, beside that layout rather than
// through it — everything else in that text, the stats and whatever chunk record they carry, is
// passed over untouched.
