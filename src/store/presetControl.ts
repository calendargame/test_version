// store/presetControl.ts — the things you can DO to the set of presets, and the only place allowed
// to do them.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT IN store/presets.ts. The registry file holds a saved value and the storage layer
// that reads it; this file holds the operations, because three of them (switching, deleting,
// and turning amnesic on or off) are not registry edits at all — they are a registry edit PLUS four
// store rehydrations, and both halves are load-bearing. Splitting them apart is what makes "did
// only the first half" impossible to write by accident. It is also what keeps the dependency graph one-way: presets.ts knows nothing
// about the four data stores, this file imports all of them, and nothing imports this file back.
//
// ⚠ THERE IS A THIRD PART, AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: remounting the five always-mounted
// mode screens. It cannot live in a store file — it is React state in src/main.tsx — and it is not an
// argument to these functions either. main.tsx SUBSCRIBES to the registry and remounts whenever
// store/amnesic's `activeDataId` changes — "which preset, and which of its two storage areas its
// stats live in" — so every path into that hazard is covered by construction rather than by a
// caller remembering. It is NOT `activeId`: repointing the preset you are already on at
// sessionStorage is the same hazard without activeId moving at all. The full argument, including
// the required-parameter design this replaced and why the subscription must not be an effect, is at
// switchPreset below.
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE IS THE PROGRAMMATIC API THE UI GROUP DRIVES. There is deliberately no UI, no top bar
// and no settings-panel wiring here — `switchPreset(id)` is the whole call a CustomSelect needs.
//
// ★ AND ONE QUESTION, NOT A SEVENTH OPERATION: `isPresetFactory(id, …)` (round 22) asks whether a
// preset holds anything a player could miss, so the delete flow can skip its confirmation for one
// that holds nothing. It reads the same four stores and the same key machinery the operations
// write through — which is precisely why it belongs here and not in the component that asks it: an
// answer derived from a second, parallel idea of what a preset IS could disagree with what
// deletePreset actually removes, and the direction that disagreement destroys data is the one a
// component could not see.

// ⚠⚠ THE TWO WAYS A STORE CAN BE POINTED AT A NEW PRESET, and BOTH are needed — see
// reloadPresetStores below, where the second one's absence was a silent isolation failure. A store
// that has storage REHYDRATES; a store that has none is set to the factory values a hydration from
// an absent payload would have produced. The defaults are the SAME factories each store hands its
// own `merge`, imported rather than re-typed, so the two answers to "what does a preset with no
// saved copy hold" cannot drift apart.

  // Optional BY NECESSITY rather than by taste: zustand's type says `persist` is always there, and
  // in a browser that refuses localStorage it is genuinely undefined (argued below).

// copy lives, how to point it at a different preset, what it holds when it has no saved copy, what
// it is holding right now, and how to read a saved copy an older build wrote. TWO WALKERS read this list (reloadPresetStores just below and
// isPresetFactory further down), and they read the SAME list on purpose: a fifth per-preset store
// added later is reloaded AND judged by the act of being listed here, where two parallel lists would
// let it become reloadable but un-checkable — a preset holding real data that the delete flow would
// then destroy without asking.
// ⚠ `makeDefaults` and `readLive` are ERASED to plain records. isPresetFactory compares JSON values
// and has no use for any store's own type; keeping the generic only as far as this factory function
// is what lets four differently-typed stores sit in one array without a cast at each of them.

  // saved copy from an OLDER version is passed through that same `migrate` here, the store's own.
  // ⚠ null MEANS "THIS BUILD CANNOT VOUCH FOR IT", and isPresetFactory reads null as "ask": a copy
  // with no version, one from a NEWER build (its `migrate` would also run on that, but only to
  // squeeze a shape this build has never seen into one it can draw — which can drop a choice the

// Reload all four from the active preset's keys, in one synchronous turn.
//
// ⚠⚠ THE NO-STORAGE BRANCH IS NOT DEFENSIVE NOISE, AND IT MUST NOT GO BACK TO BEING A SKIP.
// Zustand attaches `api.persist` only when a storage EXISTS; in a browser that refuses localStorage
// (iOS's "Block All Cookies", or any private mode that throws on the property access) the
// middleware returns before that assignment, so `store.persist` is genuinely undefined for all four
// stores at once. The first version of this line was `store.persist?.rehydrate()` and reasoned that
// "there is nothing to reload anyway". That was wrong, and the failure it left was not a crash but
// a LIE: the registry write still fires the screen remount, so the app opened "preset 2" wearing
// preset 1's score and preset 1's theme, and then accumulated every answer of the session onto
// preset 1's numbers — in both directions, all session, presenting one preset's data as another's.
// Nothing reaches disk in that browser, so nothing is permanently lost; what is broken is the one
// promise a preset makes.
// ★ SO A STORE WITH NO STORAGE IS RESET TO ITS FACTORY VALUES, which is not an approximation of a
// rehydrate — it is exactly what one does here. store/presets' mergeOverDefaults turns "no saved
// copy" into the factory values, and a memory-only browser has no saved copy for ANY preset, this
// one included. (`setState` with a partial merges, so each store keeps its own actions.)
// ⚠ Rehydration writes NOTHING. Zustand's hydrate() lands the loaded state through the RAW `set`,
// not the persist-wrapped one, so reloading a preset that has never been saved does not create its
// keys, and reloading one that has does not rewrite them. The defaults branch writes nothing

// ── IS A PRESET FACTORY-FRESH? ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ★★ THE QUESTION, IN THE OWNER'S WORDS: "if it's completely factory with no stats or anything,
// like as if you pressed clear saved defaults then full reset, then we don't need a confirmation
// when deleting that preset." So this answers "does this preset hold ANYTHING a player could miss",
// and components/PresetManager's ✕ skips its confirmation when the answer is no.
//
// ⚠⚠ THE ASYMMETRY THAT DECIDES EVERY JUDGEMENT CALL BELOW. A FALSE NEGATIVE — saying "not factory"
// about a preset that is — costs one confirmation nobody needed, and the player presses Delete. A
// FALSE POSITIVE destroys data with no question asked and no way back. So every branch here that
// cannot be certain answers FALSE, and every "should this count as data" call is resolved toward
// asking. The four places that is load-bearing are marked ⚠ where they occur.
//
// ★ WHY IT IS NOT presetStorageInUse ABOVE. "Has any key at all" is very nearly the right question
// — store/presets' mergeOverDefaults turns "no saved copy" into the factory values, so a preset with
// no keys is factory BY CONSTRUCTION — but it is not sufficient, and the gap is routine rather than
// exotic: a store writes its key the first time anything sets a value, and several of those writes
// land back on the factory value (a toggle flipped and flipped back, a mode screen mirroring blank
// stats on mount). Those presets hold KEYS and no DATA. So the test is per store, and it is
// ABSENT **or** EQUAL TO THAT STORE'S OWN DEFAULTS.

// Deep value equality over JSON. Not a shallow compare, and not JSON.stringify either: store/
// progress' defaults NEST (five Stats objects, each carrying a `times` array, beside four empty
// best-records), so `===` would call every fresh preset non-factory, and stringify would make the
// answer depend on key ORDER, which nothing guarantees across a persist round trip.
// ⚠ NaN COMPARES FALSE here (`a === b` fails and neither branch below rescues it) — which is the
// safe direction: a number that cannot be a stored value means "ask".
const sameJson = (a: unknown, b: unknown): boolean => {
  if (a === b) return true
  if (Array.isArray(a) || Array.isArray(b))
    return (

// Does one SAVED payload hold nothing but that store's factory values?
//
// ★ IT MIRRORS HYDRATION, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT THE RIGHT COMPARISON. Opening a preset runs the
// store's `migrate` on a saved copy from an older version and then merges the result over the
// defaults (`{...defaults, ...persisted}`, store/presets' mergeOverDefaults) — so that composition
// IS what this preset would open holding, and comparing it to the defaults asks exactly "would
// opening this preset show anything but a fresh one". An absent key therefore means the factory
// value, for free, with no key list to maintain.
// ★ THE MIGRATION IS THE STORE'S OWN (`upgradeSaved`, in the store table above), never a second
// copy of it written here. It matters because a preset you are not on keeps the shape of the build
// that last saved it: every preset that existed before Rotate Dots became a three-way setting still
// holds `rotateDots: false` in its settings, and compared UNMIGRATED that one leftover key made an
// untouched preset read as "holds something" — so deleting it asked a question it never used to.
// ⚠ AND AN **EXTRA** KEY, AFTER THE MIGRATION, IS STILL A DIVERGENCE. A field no version of the
// store knows (an old `lookupHistory` on a progress payload, which that store's migrate leaves in
// place) survives the spread as a key the defaults do not have, so the counts differ and the answer
// is "not factory" — a FALSE NEGATIVE by construction: whatever this file cannot account for asks
// first. The same goes for a payload `upgradeSaved` will not vouch for (no version, a newer
// build's).
// ⚠ AN UNPARSEABLE OR MIS-SHAPED ENVELOPE IS ALSO "NOT FACTORY". A truncated or tampered payload
// cannot be trusted to say the preset is empty, and store/amnesic's seedFromParked already treats
// the same corruption the same way. A `migrate` that throws lands in the same catch.

/**
 * Does this preset hold NOTHING a player could miss — every ⚙ setting at its factory value, the
 * per-mode setup at its, no stats or all-time bests, no saved personal defaults, no parked round,
 * and (for the preset you are on) nothing going on its screens? Bit-identical to a preset that has just been created, in other words, which is why
 * components/PresetManager may delete one without asking.
 *
 * ★★ THE TWO SOURCES, AND WHY BOTH ARE READ. A preset you are NOT on exists only in storage — its
 * values are not in any live store, because the live stores are always the ACTIVE preset's (store/
 * presets' presetScopedStorage). The active preset's truth is the live stores. So:
 *   • EVERY preset is judged on its SAVED copy, active or not.
 *   • The ACTIVE preset is judged on the LIVE stores AS WELL, and both must say factory.
 * Reading both rather than branching is not belt-and-braces, it closes a real false positive: in a
 * browser that refuses localStorage (iOS "Block All Cookies") NOTHING is ever written, so the
 * storage half answers "factory" for a preset that has been played in all session — and the live
 * half is the only thing that knows. For a NON-active preset that same browser genuinely holds
 * nothing (store/presetControl's own no-storage branch resets such a store to the factory values),
 * so "absent means factory" is correct there rather than merely safe.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THE PROGRESS STORE HAS TWO STORAGE AREAS AND BOTH ARE READ, which is the sharpest false
 * positive this function has to close. While a preset is AMNESIC its stats live in sessionStorage
 * and its real, permanent ones are PARKED in localStorage untouched (store/amnesic) — so the live
 * store shows a zeroed session while the device still holds the player's record. Deleting removes
 * BOTH (clearPresetStorage calls discardSessionStats beside the four key removals), so both have to
 * count: the loop reads the parked copy off localStorage, and the session copy is read after it.
 *
 * ⚠ AMNESIC ITSELF IS NOT CONSULTED, and that is the owner's decided call, not an omission: a
 * preset that is otherwise untouched but has Amnesic switched on still counts as factory, because
 * nothing is lost by deleting it — the flag is a statement about where stats WOULD go, and there
 * are none. (It is a registry field anyway — store/presets' `Preset.amnesic` — so it is outside
 * everything this function reads by construction.)
 *
 * ⚠ NEITHER IS THE PRESET'S NAME, OR ITS POSITION IN THE LIST, and the owner's own yardstick is
 * what settles it: "as if you pressed clear saved defaults then full reset". Neither of those
 * buttons touches the name or the order, so a preset renamed to "Weekend" and never played in is
 * exactly the state that recipe produces and is factory by his definition. The confirmation this
 * skips says nothing about a name either — it names the stats, the bests, the
 * per-mode setup, the ⚙ settings and the saved defaults — so skipping it cannot withhold a warning
 * that was ever there. (Both are registry fields anyway, like amnesic, so they are outside what
 * this function reads.)
 *
 * ⚠ THE SESSION PAGE IS DELIBERATELY NOT COUNTED, and it is the one entry in clearPresetStorage
 * that this function skips, so the difference is stated rather than left to be noticed.
 * store/sessionMode records which of the seven pages a preset was last showing THIS session — which
 * every visit writes, and which a full app close throws away on its own. Counting it would mean any
 * preset you had so much as looked at could never be deleted without a question, for a value no
 * player can miss. Every other entry in that function IS counted — parked casual play
 * (store/sessionHistory) only for a preset other than the active one, whose screens `screensFresh`
 * below already speaks for (see the note at its check).
 *
 * ★★ `screensFresh` — THE ONE THING NO STORE AND NO KEY HOLDS: WHAT IS ON THE ACTIVE PRESET'S
 * SCREENS RIGHT NOW. A Blitz round or MoX run IN PROGRESS is written nowhere at all (store/
 * sessionRound parks only ENDED ones, and only when sessionStorage will take them), yet deleting the
 * active preset remounts every screen and throws it away — so a check built from storage alone
 * called a preset with a 7-of-10 MoX run on screen "factory" and deleted it, run and all, without
 * the question that exists to warn about exactly that. The answer is src/main.tsx's aggregate of the
 * five mode screens' own freshness reports (each one's `onFreshChange` — config, stats, history, a
 * live or ended round, its UI toggles), the SAME signal Full Reset's dim reads, handed in by the
 * caller because it is React state this file cannot see. It is REQUIRED rather than defaulted: a
 * default of `true` is precisely the false positive above, waiting for a caller that forgot.
 *   • It is consulted for the ACTIVE preset only. The screens only ever hold the active preset —
 *     every other preset is judged, correctly, on what it left in storage.
 *   • It also covers an ended round on screen that could NOT be parked (sessionStorage refused):
 *     `hasSessionRound` below cannot see that one, and the screen's own report can.
 *   • ⚠ It can only add "not factory", never remove it — the same asymmetry as every term above.
 *     A screen reads un-fresh for a few things no player would call data (a Show Codes panel left
 *     open, say), and each of those costs one unneeded question.

 * ★ THE ONLY OPERATION IN THIS FILE THAT IS A REGISTRY EDIT AND NOTHING ELSE, and the reason is
 * worth stating because it is what makes it cheap: ORDER IS THE ARRAY ORDER (store/presets rejected
 * a separate `order` field on sight), and `presetKey` is a pure function of a preset's ID, which
 * this never touches. So a reorder moves no bytes — not one storage key changes, nothing rehydrates
 * — and it must NOT remount the screens either: store/amnesic's activeDataId deliberately ignores
 * everything about the registry except which preset is live and which of its two storage areas its
 * stats are in, so a player reordering the list mid-run keeps the run. That exclusion is written
 * down at activeDataId; this function is the second thing relying on it (renaming was the first).
 * ⚠ IT STILL LIVES HERE RATHER THAN AS AN ACTION ON THE STORE, and for the opposite reason to its

 * deliberately the registry's ONE low-level door and this file is the only room it opens into. A
 * second door on the store — even a harmless one — is what store/presets' "state plus one applier"
 * note refuses, because the next one added would not be harmless.
 *
 * ★★ UP/DOWN CONTROLS, NOT DRAG-TO-REORDER, AND THE PRICE OF THE OTHER ANSWER IS ALREADY PAID.
 * Dragging is the obvious gesture for an ordered list. This app has TWO recorded cases of a pointer
 * gesture that passed in Chromium every time and FAILED on the owner's iPhone (round 11's mode
 * selector, cases A and B), and both were cured by DELETING gesture code rather than by writing
 * more — the platform reason is at the top of components/CustomSelect. There is no drag-reorder
 * machinery in this repo, so introducing some would be a third chance to re-derive that bug, for a
 * list that is realistically two or three rows long. A swap is one array write and cannot fail on

 * ★★ SWITCHING IS STRUCTURALLY A SECOND FULL RESET, AND THE HALF THIS FUNCTION CANNOT DO IS THE
 * SCREEN REMOUNT. Reloading the four stores moves the SAVED data, but the five always-mounted mode
 * screens and the guide hold state of their own — the run in progress, the current question, the
 * timers, and the stats each screen hydrated ONCE ON MOUNT and mirrors back on every change — that
 * no store reload can reach. Leave them mounted across a switch and the very next answered question
 * writes the OLD preset's stats into the NEW preset. That is not a hypothetical: it was reproduced
 * against the real stores, and a device with 500 cards ended up holding 4.
 *
 * ★ WHO DOES THE REMOUNT, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT TO THIS FUNCTION. The first draft made it a
 * REQUIRED parameter — `switchPreset(id, remountScreens)` — reasoning that TypeScript can refuse a
 * call that forgets it where a comment cannot. Two things beat that:
 *   • it enforces PRESENCE, not correctness. `switchPreset(id, () => {})` type-checks, and so does
 *     a callback that bumps four of the five keys — which is the actual failure, silently, on one
 *     screen. Meanwhile deletePreset has to demand the same callback and then ignore it whenever
 *     the preset being deleted is not the active one, which teaches a reader it is optional.
 *   • it makes the remount a DUTY re-derived at every call site — a future deep link, a multi-tab
 *     sync, the UI that has not been written yet — when it is really a CONSEQUENCE of one fact:
 *     the active preset changed.
 * So src/main.tsx SUBSCRIBES to the registry and remounts whenever store/amnesic's `activeDataId`
 * changes (see `remountScreens` there and the subscription beside it), so setPresetAmnesic below
 * rides the same wire. Every path that can repoint the data — this one, deletePreset,
 * setPresetAmnesic, and anything added later — is covered by construction, and the UI group's
 * switcher is a one-liner: `switchPreset(id)`.
 *   ⚠ A SUBSCRIPTION, NOT AN EFFECT, AND THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART. zustand runs subscribers
 *     SYNCHRONOUSLY inside the `applyRegistry` set below, so the five remount-key bumps are already
 *     scheduled before the four rehydrations run and React commits the whole thing at once: the
 *     screens come back ALREADY holding the incoming preset. An effect keyed on activeId would
 *     leave one commit in which the stores hold the new preset while the screens still hold the
 *     old — safe only for as long as no mode screen's stat-mirror effect happens to re-fire in it,
 *     which is a dependency array's business and not a contract anybody signed.
 *   ⚠ WHAT main.tsx MUST **NOT** DO on a switch is the rest of fullReset. resetSettings /
 *     resetProgress / resetModePrefs would overwrite the preset you just opened with defaults — a
 *     switch that wipes its own destination. Only the discard half.
 *
 * ORDER: registry first — which both schedules the remount and means that from this line on no
 * store considers the old preset active — then the four reloads. One synchronous turn, so nothing
 * can write in between: there is no window in which a store is pointed at one preset while holding
 * another's.
 * ⚠ THAT WINDOW WAS ONCE OPENED FROM INSIDE THIS VERY TURN, by the storage-full retry: the registry
 * write succeeding re-saved "whatever each refused store holds now" through that store's adapter —
 * which already pointed at the INCOMING preset while the stores still held the OUTGOING one. A
 * refused save is now held under its own destination key and retried to that key only
 * (store/storageHealth), so nothing in this turn can write one preset's values under another's; and
 * the reloads below read the outgoing preset's held values back when the player returns to it.

/**
 * Make a preset amnesic, or stop. Returns false when there is nothing to do (unknown id, or the
 * flag is already what was asked for).
 *
 * ★★ IT IS THE SAME OPERATION AS switchPreset, WITH A DIFFERENT REASON. Flipping this flag repoints
 * the progress store at the OTHER storage area (store/amnesic's presetStatsStorage), which is
 * structurally identical to repointing it at another preset's keys — and the five always-mounted
 * mode screens hydrate their stats ONCE, at mount, and mirror them back on every change. Leave them
 * mounted across the flip and the next answered question writes the numbers they are still holding
 * into whichever copy is now live. That is the 500-cards-becomes-4 bug with a different trigger, so
 * it gets the identical treatment: registry write first (which schedules the remount, because
 * src/main.tsx is subscribed to store/amnesic's activeDataId and not to activeId alone), then the
 * rehydrations, all in one synchronous turn with no window in between.
 *
 * ★ THE TOGGLE RULE, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE:
 *     ON  → the saved stats are PARKED, UNTOUCHED; the session starts at ZERO.
 *     OFF → the session's stats are DISCARDED; the saved stats come back exactly as they were.
 *   Both directions are the SAME LINE — discard the session copy, then reload. Turning ON, the
 *   discard is what guarantees a zero start even if this preset was amnesic earlier in the same
 *   browsing session (the store then re-derives from store/amnesic's seed). Turning OFF, it is what
 *   guarantees the session's numbers cannot be reconciled into the permanent ones afterwards:
 *   ⚠⚠ MERGING A SESSION BACK IS BANNED, and this is the line that makes it unwritable — by the
 *   time anything permanent is read again, the session's numbers no longer exist anywhere.
 *   ⚠⚠ …AND NEITHER DO ITS ROUNDS. An ended Blitz round / MoX run carries a Best
 *   floor and a round id, and the screen that restores it reconciles it into the live Bests — so a
 *   guest round that survived the flip WAS a merge, by another door (reproduced: it replaced,
 *   lowered or erased permanent bests). The session copy's parked rounds are discarded with its
 *   stats, and store/sessionRound keys every parked round by the copy it was played on, so neither
 *   copy's round can ever be restored against the other.
 *
 * ⚠ IT REHYDRATES ALL FOUR STORES, not just progress. Only progress can have moved, so the other
 * three re-read the values they already hold — a genuine no-op, since every one of them writes
 * synchronously on every set, and a save the device refused is read back from where
 * store/storageHealth holds it, so none of them has an in-memory state to lose. It is
 * reloadPresetStores for the same reason switchPreset uses it: ONE reload path means a fifth
 * per-preset store added later is covered by being listed there, and there is no second, narrower
 * copy for a future change to forget to widen.
 *
 * ⚠ SWITCHING AWAY AND BACK IS NOT A TOGGLE and deliberately keeps the session going: the session
 * copy is keyed per preset and nothing here runs on a switch, so an amnesic preset you left and
 * returned to still has its session. You never closed the app; that is the only event that ends one.

 * consequence stated out loud, because it is permanent:
 *   • A build that has never heard of presets — an old cached build, or the other site on this
 *     shared origin — reads the un-namespaced keys and only those. After this, they are gone, so
 *     that build opens factory-fresh. That is HONEST rather than broken: preset 1's data really was
 *     deleted, and no build that predates presets could ever have shown preset 2's.
 *   • Slot 1 is then vacant FOREVER. Ids are allocated forward and never reused, so no future
 *     preset is written into the un-namespaced keys. If an old build later plays and writes them,
 *     that data belongs to no preset and this app will never show it — bounded, and it is that
 *     build's own data.
 *   • REJECTED: promoting another preset into slot 1 (copying its keys onto the un-namespaced ones)
 *     to keep an ignorant build showing "something". That is the copy-migration this whole design
 *     exists to delete — the half-finished copy, the interleaved-build data loss, the run-twice
 *     hazard — reintroduced for a cosmetic benefit to a build nobody is running.
 *

 * removed (and, when it was active, so the remount is scheduled before anything else happens); then
