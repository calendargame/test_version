// userDefaults.ts — the user's saved PERSONAL DEFAULTS (Session 11, "Save Defaults").
//
// The ⚙ footer's Save Defaults button snapshots the full 16-value settings panel PLUS the four
// capturable mode-screen prefs (Flash reveal speed, both Blitz timer lengths, the AoX run length —
// deliberately NOT Blitz Per-Round/Per-Question, Deduction sub-type, Allow Mistakes, One-by-One,
// or the show/hide stat toggles) PLUS, since round 20, the active preset's Amnesic setting (Off,
// Stats Only or Full) at the moment of saving. From then on those saved values — not the factory
// constants — are what "default" means everywhere: Reset Settings restores the saved panel values
// AND the four prefs (extended to the prefs in round 6 — it used to be panel-only) AND the saved
// Amnesic setting,
// Full Reset does the same (it delegates its ENTIRE settings restore to resetSettings, Amnesic
// included — see main.tsx's resetSettings) and additionally wipes stats/history and returns every
// non-capturable mode pref to factory, and the gear's "modified" bar lights when live state
// diverges from the panel + prefs — AMNESIC INCLUDED as of round 22.
// ⚠ THAT LAST CLAUSE USED TO READ "NEVER for Amnesic", on the reasoning that the flag is a property
// of the preset rather than a settings value. The premise was right and the conclusion was a BUG:
// the gear's bar, Reset Settings' dim and Save Defaults' dim are one expression (main.tsx's
// settingsAtDefaults), so excluding Amnesic from it left Save Defaults dimmed and INERT whenever
// Amnesic was the only thing a player had changed — making "Amnesic: on" impossible to capture into
// the very snapshot this file says captures it. It is compared there now, against
// effectiveAmnesicDefault below, and every offer that lights as a result genuinely acts on it.
// ★ THE SAVED AMNESIC SETTING IS ALSO WHAT A FRESH APP OPEN STARTS EACH PRESET ON
// (store/sessionAmnesic): the setting itself is held for the browsing session only, and this
// snapshot is the one permanent thing that says what it should be the next time the app is opened.
//
// A THIRD store (not a settings-store v2) because the capture spans two stores — it belongs to
// neither — and because surviving Full Reset must be an explicit property: Full Reset deliberately
// does NOT clear this store (restoring "your" defaults requires them to outlive it); the only way
// back to factory is the ⚙ footer's "Clear Saved Defaults" link (clearDefaults) — the single clear
// affordance (Round-4 removed the Save Defaults popup's duplicate link), always reachable: at
// steady state live == saved dims + locks the Save Defaults button, but never the footer link.
//
// `saved` is null until the user saves (null = factory semantics everywhere, via the effective*
// helpers below). Same persist pattern as the other stores (localStorage 'cg-userdefaults-v1',
// versioned, partialize strips the actions).

// The four capturable mode-screen prefs. aoxN stays a STRING like the modePrefs field it mirrors;
// it is normalized (normalizeAoxN) at save time, and every comparison re-normalizes defensively —
// the live store can hold transient unclamped strings ('', '007') mid-typing.
