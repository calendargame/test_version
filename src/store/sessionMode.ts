// store/sessionMode.ts — the CURRENT PAGE, per preset, for THIS browsing session only (round 21).
//
// WHAT IT IS. src/main.tsx's `mode` was `useState("classic")` — app-global, not persisted, not
// per-preset. Round 21 makes "which page you are on" a per-preset fact with the SAME lifetime Amnesic's
// session stats already use: it survives a reload, and a full app close throws it away.
//   • On a COLD OPEN (no session entry for a preset) that preset opens on its `defaultMode` ⚙
//     setting (store/settings, read via readStoredDefaultMode).
//   • On a page change, the active preset's session page is written here.
//   • On a preset switch, the incoming preset shows its session page if it has one THIS session,
//     else its `defaultMode`.
// So: cold open → go to preset 2 → preset 2's default page; then, still in the session, switch away
// and back → preset 2's LAST page; next cold open → back to the default.
//
// WHY sessionStorage AND NOT a zustand store. It is a tiny key→value map with no reactivity needs
// (main.tsx reads it once per switch and once at boot, and writes it from switchMode), and
// sessionStorage IS the "gone on a full close, kept across a reload" lifetime — exactly what
// store/amnesic reaches for. A store would add a persist adapter and a subscription for nothing.
//
// KEYED BY PRESET ID in ONE JSON blob under a single key, so "forget this preset" is one delete of
// one entry and "forget everything" is the browser closing the session. A deleted preset's entry
// is cleared by store/presetControl's clearPresetStorage (ids are never reused, so a leftover entry
// is harmless, but "remove exactly its keys" is a house rule).
//
// ⚠ EVERY ACCESS IS try/catch-WRAPPED. sessionStorage throws on the property access in locked-down
// browsing (iOS "Block All Cookies", some private modes); a page-memory that cannot be written just
// means every cold open uses `defaultMode`, which is a fine degradation and never breaks a render.
