// store/sessionGuide.ts — How to Play's PLACE (its open section and how far down you had read), kept
// across a RELOAD.
//
// THE OWNER'S RULE (store/browsingSession): "only truly closing the app starts fresh." The guide
// already held its place through every detour inside the app — it stays mounted (the open section is
// GuidePage's own state) and src/main.tsx keeps the reading offset in guideScrollYRef — but both lived
// only in memory, so a reload (a browser reload, the update reload) put the reader back at the top with
// every section closed. This keeps the two for the session's lifetime, and a real close still clears
// them (the browser drops sessionStorage).
//
// ★ ITS LIFECYCLE:
//   • WRITTEN WHEN THE PAGE IS HIDDEN (lib/pageHidden) — `pagehide` (every reload fires it) and
//     `visibilitychange` → hidden (a backgrounded tab the browser may later discard fired that on its
//     way out). Never on scroll: the offset is only needed when the page goes away, so a reader's
//     scrolling costs nothing. GuidePage parks; App hands it the reading offset (main.tsx's
//     readGuideOffset, the one place that knows it — live while the guide is on screen, remembered
//     while it is not).
//   • RETIRED WHEN THE GUIDE UNMOUNTS — which a reload never does, and a crash onto the error card
//     does (so a place that somehow broke the guide cannot come back and break it again). A guide
//     that crashes on its very FIRST render never mounted, so it has no unmount: its error boundary
//     discards the place for it (src/main.tsx, ModeErrorBoundary's onCrash).
//   • AND DISCARDED BY FULL RESET (src/main.tsx's fullReset), which returns the guide to its launch
//     state — the top, every section closed — by remounting it. It must be discarded THERE, before
//     the remount renders: the new GuidePage reads its place during that render, before the old
//     one's unmount cleanup would run.
// ★ A PRESET SWITCH DOES NOT TOUCH IT. The guide is not a preset's: it reads no saved data, so a
// preset switch, an Amnesic change and deleting the preset you are on leave it mounted, with its
// open section and its reading offset exactly where they were.
//
// ONE SMALL JSON VALUE under one key; `cg-guide-place-v1` is new, so no older build on this shared
// origin reads it. Anything unreadable in it — a build this one has never seen, a hand-edited value —
// reads as "no place": the guide opens at the top with every section closed, as it always did. A
// section id this build does not have simply opens nothing, and the offset is clamped by the browser
// like any other scroll write. Every access is try/catch-wrapped (locked-down browsing throws on the
// property access, where the place is simply not kept).
