// store/sessionHistory.ts — a casual mode's back/forward history, kept for the BROWSING SESSION.
//
// THE OWNER'S RULE (store/browsingSession): "only truly closing the app starts fresh." Classic, Flash
// and Deduction keep their lifetime STATS in store/progress, but the history behind them (the cards
// Back and Forward walk, each with its Override record) and the question waiting to be answered live
// only in the engine's memory — so anything that rebuilt the screen threw them away. This file keeps
// them for exactly the session's lifetime, across everything that rebuilds a screen without the
// player asking for a clean start:
//   • a RELOAD — a browser reload, the app's own update reload, the error card's Reload;
//   • a PRESET SWITCH — each preset's history is waiting when you switch back to it;
//   • an AMNESIC interlude (Stats Only or Full) — your own history, parked for the session, returns
//     with your own stats when the preset is back on Off (and the session's is thrown away with the
//     session).
// A real close clears it (the browser drops sessionStorage; nothing here schedules a wipe).
//
// THIS FILE IS THE STORAGE HALF, and it never looks inside what it stores — the same split as
// store/sessionRound. What a parked history IS (the engine without its saved times, cut to fit), and
// what is accepted on the way back (only through the one engine restore door, and only the exact
// state the saved stats support), is engine/parkedHistory's. The screens' wiring — when they park,
// and what the question on screen does when it comes back — is modes/modeHooks'.
//
// ★ WHEN IT IS WRITTEN — WHEN A SCREEN IS ABOUT TO GO AWAY, NOT ON EVERY MOVE. A history is thousands
// of cards long at the far end, and serialising it after every answer would put that cost on every
// answer. Nothing needs it until the screen goes, and a screen never goes unannounced:
//   • the PAGE going away or to the background — every reload fires `pagehide`, and a mobile browser
//     that later discards a backgrounded tab fired `visibilitychange` → hidden on the way out;
//   • the STATS COPY underneath the screens being swapped — a preset switch, an Amnesic change, the
//     active preset being deleted — which src/main.tsx sees in its registry subscription, while the
//     outgoing screens are still mounted and still hold the outgoing copy.
// Both call modes/modeHooks' parkCasualHistories, which parks every mounted casual screen under the
// stats copy it was MOUNTED on. ⚠ A screen does NOT park when it unmounts: an unmount cannot tell a
// preset switch from a Full Reset or a crash, and parking on either of those would bring back
// exactly what they exist to throw away.
// ★ WHEN IT IS RETIRED — BY WHATEVER CLEARS THE HISTORY IT DESCRIBES, at the moment it clears it, so
// a park can never bring cleared data back:
//   • Reset Stats / "Enable and Reset Stats" / Flash's Reset — the engine's own reset; the screen
//     discards its slot in the same breath (modes/modeHooks' useParkedHistory);
//   • Full Reset — discards the preset's histories, every copy's, BEFORE its remount (src/main.tsx);
//   • a preset DELETE — store/presetControl's clearPresetStorage, after the registry write that
//     parks the outgoing screens, so the delete has the last word;
//   • an Amnesic change — the SESSION copies' histories, with the session's stats, same ordering;
//   • a mode screen that CRASHES — src/main.tsx's error boundary hook, so a history that somehow
//     breaks its screen cannot come back after the Reload and break it again.
//
// ★ SIZE. sessionStorage has a fixed allowance (~5 MB, shared by the whole origin — live and staging
// both), and it also holds things that are NOT best-effort: an Amnesic preset's session stats above
// all, whose refused write puts up the storage-full notice. A history must never be the thing that
// crowds those out, so every history together is held to TOTAL_BUDGET characters, and any one to
// SLOT_BUDGET (so two long histories — say two Deduction sub-types — can both be kept):
//   • a history longer than its slot budget is parked with its OLDEST cards forgotten (engine/
//     parkedHistory's fittedParkedText — the scores, the badge numbers and every remaining card's
//     Override stay exact; Back just stops sooner). Measured: a weekday card is ~165 characters, so
//     that is still ~3,000 Classic or Flash cards; a Deduction puzzle carries its options, so Day and
//     Year keep ~2,000 and Month (the largest, ~520) ~950 — an hour or more of non-stop play each;
//   • if all of them together would pass the total budget, OTHER parked histories are dropped,
//     longest first, until the one being written fits. ★ THE SCREEN IN USE IS WRITTEN LAST
//     (parkCasualHistories orders the writes), so it is the one history that always survives; the
//     ones dropped are other modes', other sub-types' and other presets';
//   • a write the browser refuses anyway removes the slot, so an older parked copy can never come
//     back in its place. The history then simply starts over — never an error, and never the
//     storage-full notice (this is a convenience, not saved data).
//
// ⚠ THE KEY IS `cg-history-v1:<dataId>:<silo>` — one entry per (stats copy, silo), so parking one
// silo never re-serialises another's thousands of cards, and "forget this preset" is a prefix sweep.
// KEYED BY THE STATS COPY (store/amnesic's dataId — "<presetId>:saved", "<presetId>:stats" or
// "<presetId>:session", one per Amnesic value): a history only ever comes back over the stats it
// was played on.
// No older build knows the prefix, so none of them reads it (live and staging share this origin); a
// later build that changes the parked shape must change the version in the prefix, and the restore
// door refuses any blob it cannot read anyway.
// ⚠ THE VALUE IS ONE MARK AND THEN THE TEXT. The mark is this file's own, the one thing it needs to
// know about a slot without opening it: does it hold PLAY (history, an answered question, a screen
// setting — anything the player would miss), or only the unanswered question a screen was waiting
// on? Every casual screen parks, played-in or not, because the waiting question has to come back
// too; but only the first kind makes a preset "not factory-fresh" (hasSessionHistory).
// ⚠ Every access is try/catch-wrapped: sessionStorage throws on the property access in locked-down
// browsing, where a history simply is not kept.
