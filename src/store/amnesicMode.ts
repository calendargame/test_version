// store/amnesicMode.ts — the three values of the Amnesic setting, and the ONE reader of every stored
// spelling of it.
//
// THE THREE VALUES (the ⚙ pill's Off / Stats Only / Full):
//   'off'   — everything is saved, as if the setting did not exist.
//   'stats' — STATS ONLY: the stats strip belongs to the session (every mode's score, accuracy,
//             streak and solve times start from zero and are gone on a real close), while the round
//             modes' BESTS are the permanent ones — shown, beatable, and saved for good.
//   'full'  — the whole of a preset's saved progress belongs to the session: stats AND bests.
// What each one keeps where is store/amnesic's (AMNESIC_CLEARS); which value a preset has right now is
// store/sessionAmnesic's. This file is only the value and its spellings, and imports nothing, so
// every store can read it.

//
// ★ TWO FIELDS, AND THE OLDER ONE IS KEPT ON PURPOSE. Until this setting became three-way it was a
// boolean called `amnesic`. Live and staging share one browser origin, so a build from before the
// change can read anything this one saves — and what such a build does with a value it does not
// recognise in `amnesic` is treat the preset as NOT amnesic: it would record a guest's play into the
// permanent stats of a preset saved as a guest preset. So the boolean keeps its name and its meaning
// ("some kind of amnesic"), and the kind rides beside it in a field an older build never reads:
//
//     amnesic: boolean          true for Stats Only and for Full — what an older build acts on
//     amnesicMode: AmnesicMode  which of the three — what this build acts on
//
// To an older build a Stats Only default is therefore a plain Amnesic one, which is the safe
// direction: it keeps nothing of the session at all. When an older build saves the snapshot again it
// writes its boolean and drops `amnesicMode`, and the reader below turns that back into Off or Full.

/**
 * ★ THE ONE READER — every stored copy of the setting comes through here: a saved-defaults snapshot
 * (the active preset's in store/userDefaults, any other preset's read straight off its key), the
 * `amnesic` flag an older build keeps on the preset registry, and a value in the session's own record
 * (store/sessionAmnesic). Pure, total, and keyed on the SHAPE it finds rather than on a version
 * number, because an older build can rewrite any of these at any time:
 *   • no `amnesicMode` — an older build's copy, where the boolean is all there is: true → 'full',
 *     false or absent → 'off' (a snapshot from before the setting existed has neither field, and
 *     that preset was never amnesic);
 *   • a known `amnesicMode` — that value, unless the boolean beside it says amnesic while the mode
 *     says off, which no build writes; then the more amnesic reading wins.
 * ⚠ ANYTHING IT DOES NOT RECOGNISE READS AS 'full' — a mode a newer build added, a boolean that is
 * not one. The two wrong answers are not equal: reading "off" for a preset that was meant to forget
 * writes a guest's play into the owner's permanent record, which cannot be undone; reading "full"
 * for one that was meant to remember shows a zeroed, dashed strip and the pill on Full, loses nothing
 * that was already saved, and is put right with one tap. So every doubt resolves toward not
 * recording.
