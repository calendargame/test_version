// store/storageUsage.ts — HOW FULL THE DEVICE'S ROOM FOR THIS APP IS, AND WHAT IS FILLING IT.
//
// Every solve time is kept, so the saved data grows with play, and a browser gives a site a fixed
// allowance. store/storageHealth says what happens when a save does not fit; this file is the
// warning BEFORE that: how much is used, the "Storage used" line in ⚙ that shows it, and a popup
// that opens by itself once when usage first passes STORAGE_WARN_PERCENT
// (components/StorageUsagePopup).
//
// ★ HOW MUCH IS USED — A RUNNING COUNT, NEVER A RE-READ. What the allowance counts is every key's
// name plus its text, in characters. The device is counted ONCE when the page loads (one pass over
// its keys); from then on store/storageHealth — the door every save goes through — reports each
// write and each removal AFTER it has landed, with the text now there, and the count moves by
// exactly that difference. Another tab's changes arrive the same way (the browser's `storage`
// event, through the same door). So the figure is right the moment a save lands or a reset, a Clear
// History or a preset delete takes something away — and an answer costs it one addition, however
// much is saved. (The two leaf modules that write a few characters around the door are picked up at
// the next count: a page load, or the popup opening.)
// It counts localStorage and nothing else: a session copy of an Amnesic preset lives in
// sessionStorage, which has an allowance of its own and empties itself.
//
// ★ WHAT IS FILLING IT is a second, slower reading (readStorageUsage) — it has to look inside the
// saved progress to tell one mode's solve times from another's — and only the popup shows it, so it
// is taken when the popup opens and at no other time. Sorted into who owns what:
//   • a preset's SOLVE TIMES, per mode: the times inside its progress key, and its sealed chunk keys
//     (store/progressStorage). ⚠ Every chunk key counts toward the SIZE, a superseded one included —
//     Reset Stats for that mode is what gets the room back — but the COUNT of times is the ones a
//     save actually names: the sealed count plus the tail.
//   • LOOKUP HISTORY (one list, shared by every preset);
//   • a preset's OTHER data: its Bests, ⚙ settings, per-mode setup and saved defaults;
//   • everything else (the preset list, small markers).
//
// ★ THE LIMIT IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. A browser has no way to ask how much localStorage a site may
// use, and the browsers do not agree (Chromium allows 5,242,880 characters; Safari is documented at
// half that). A percentage of an assumed figure would read "50%" on a device that is full. So the
// app finds out how many MORE characters the device will take (store/storageHealth's measureRoom —
// it writes one scratch key and removes it again), and the limit is what is used plus that. It is
// remembered (LIMIT_KEY) and not measured again unless it is shown to be wrong:
//   • a save the device REFUSES teaches a limit on the spot — what the device holds at that moment —
//     marked as not yet measured, because it is short by up to the size of the refused save.
//     ⚠ ONCE, AT THE REFUSAL THAT BEGINS THE EPISODE, and never again while it lasts. What the
//     device holds goes on changing while a save is held, and the thing that most often changes it
//     is the player making room: taught again then, the "limit" would be the little that is left
//     after a Reset Stats, and the line would read 100% on a device that had just been emptied;
//   • usage found ABOVE the remembered limit means the limit was too low.
// ⚠ WHEN IT IS MEASURED (measureStorageLimit). Measuring stops the page for a moment — tens of
// milliseconds where the first guess is right — so it is done where nobody can be in the middle of
// anything:
//   • AS THE APP STARTS, before its first screen exists (src/main.tsx's entry calls it ahead of the
//     first render — the Loading screen is what is showing). No question has been drawn, so no solve
//     clock can be running, and the "Storage used" line is right the first time it is seen;
//   • WHEN THE PLAYER OPENS ⚙, OR THE BREAKDOWN POPUP — with no flash, run or round under way
//     (lib/playerBusy's isRoundLive; a casual question just waits behind the menu). That is where a
//     limit that has since been shown wrong is put right without waiting for the next start.
// And never while a save is being held: the device is full then, and what a measurement would find
// is the room the held save is about to take.
// ⚠ A DEVICE THAT COULD NOT BE MEASURED has no percentage, and none is shown: `percent` is null, the
// ⚙ line shows a dash, and there is no warning.
//
// ★ THE POPUP OPENS BY ITSELF ONCE PER UPWARD CROSSING — and never while the player is busy
// (lib/playerBusy: a flash, run or round under way, a timed question waiting, or a text box in use).
// The line's colour and the gear's dot change the moment usage crosses (they are read straight off
// the count); the popup waits for the next moment the player is free — or for the player to open ⚙,
// which is stepping away from a casual question by choice (a round, a run or a flash still has to
// end first: it keeps running behind the menu). "Already warned" is written down only when the
// popup has actually opened (WARNED_KEY — on the device, so not on every open, not on a reload, not
// again while usage stays above the line; and for this page as well, in case a full device cannot
// take even that marker). A reading back under the line forgets it, so a later rise is a new
// crossing. Live and staging share one copy of the data, and therefore this marker too: one warning
