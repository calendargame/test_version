// store/sessionLookup.ts — what is ON SCREEN in Lookup, kept across a RELOAD.
//
// THE OWNER'S RULE (store/browsingSession): "only truly closing the app starts fresh." Lookup's
// HISTORY LIST is saved for good (store/lookupHistory). What the player had on the screen above it —
// the text in the date box, the answer or message being shown, which history row is selected, and
// whether Show Codes is open — was plain App state, so a reload (a browser reload, the app's own
// update reload) emptied the box and closed the codes under them. This keeps those values for the
// browsing session; a real close clears them (the browser drops sessionStorage).
//
// ★ IT BELONGS TO THE APP, NOT TO A PRESET. The history list is shared by every preset, so what is
// selected in it — and the box, the answer and the codes that follow from the selection — is too:
// a preset switch, an Amnesic change and deleting the preset you are on all leave it exactly as it
// was. What a preset CAN change under it is the Date Format the box is typed in, which is why the
// format the text was written in is kept beside it (`format`): components/LookupCard compares that
// with the live one and applies its one format-change rule, whether the format changed with the
// card on screen or while it was away.
//
// ★ WRITTEN ON EVERY CHANGE, NOT WHEN THE PAGE HIDES. The whole value is a few dozen characters, so
// there is nothing to save by waiting — and writing as it changes means it does not depend on the
// page being told it is going away. (The casual modes' histories and the guide's place do wait for
// that, because theirs are large or change every frame: store/sessionHistory, store/sessionGuide.)
// src/main.tsx owns the values and mirrors them here in one effect; so the two things that reset
// them — Clear and Full Reset — clear this with them, with nothing to remember.
//
// ONE SMALL JSON VALUE under one key; `cg-lookup-screen-v1` is new, so no older build on this shared
// origin reads it. It is read back through a full shape check: anything unreadable — a build this
// one has never seen, a hand-edited value — reads as "nothing kept", and Lookup opens empty as it
// always did. (A selected row that is no longer in the history list is dropped by LookupCard's own
// orphaned-selection cleanup; a format this build does not know simply differs from the live one,
// which is the format-change rule's case.) Every access is try/catch-wrapped: locked-down browsing
// throws on the property access, where the screen is simply not kept.
