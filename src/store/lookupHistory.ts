// store/lookupHistory.ts — Lookup's saved history, SHARED across every preset (round 20).
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE, NOT PART OF store/progress ANY MORE. Every other silo store/progress
// holds — stats, all-time bests — answers "how did THIS PRESET do", so it is right that switching
// presets swaps it out from under you. A Lookup is not a performance record, it is a question you
// asked ("what day was July 4, 1776?"), and the answer to THAT question does not depend on which
// preset happens to be open — asking it from Preset 2 and then switching to Preset 3 should still
// show it, the same way it would if presets did not exist. So this list is deliberately NOT one of
// the four keys store/presets namespaces per preset: it is global data, like the build stamp
// (lib/buildStamp) or the changelog's seen-signature (src/changelog) — it describes something the
// DEVICE remembers, not something any one preset owns — except unlike those two flags it is
// reactive UI state a component renders, so it needs zustand rather than a plain synchronous read.
// It therefore goes through zustand's OWN default localStorage adapter directly, exactly the way
// store/presets' registry store persists itself — never presetScopedStorage or presetStatsStorage,
// which would namespace or session-park it per preset, the one thing this list must never do.
//
// ⚠ THERE IS NO MIGRATION FROM store/progress'S OLD `lookupHistory` FIELD, on the same "preset 1
// IS the data, never a copy" principle store/presets states for itself: a rewrite that copied the
// old field over on first boot would be exactly the half-finished-copy/run-twice hazard that
// principle exists to delete, for a feature far smaller than presets. A device's existing saved
// lookups are simply left behind under the old key, unread from here on — store/progress's own
// `merge` still spreads that key in from an old payload harmlessly (nothing there reads it any
// more, and the very next save drops it, since it is no longer in that store's PERSISTED_KEYS) —
// see the version-bump note on that store's `persist` options for the full reasoning and its test.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE OWNS, in two halves:
//   • the PERMANENT list (`useLookupHistory`) — localStorage-backed, one un-namespaced key,
//     survives forever exactly like today's saved Lookup history always has;
//   • the SESSION-ONLY overflow (`useLookupSession`) — sessionStorage-backed, for lookups made
//     while the ACTIVE preset is on Amnesic: Full (store/amnesic), which must never reach the permanent list
//     but still have to appear on screen for the rest of the browsing session. See that store's
//     header for what "session" means here (survives a refresh, gone when the browser closes) —
//     the identical promise an amnesic preset's session copy makes, for the same reason: a
//     browser can only honestly promise to forget what it never wrote down permanently.
//     (Under Amnesic: Stats Only a lookup is saved normally — it is not a stat.)
//     ⚠ IT IS NOT KEYED BY PRESET, unlike an amnesic preset's session copy (store/amnesic's `statsKey`).
//     That key exists per preset because the store it shadows is per-preset; this list is GLOBAL,
//     so its session overflow is one bucket for the whole browsing session, not one per preset. A
//     lookup made while Preset 2 was on Full and one made while Preset 4 was on Full later in the
//     same session sit in the same bucket — consistent with the permanent list being one shared
//     list too. Nothing here ever reads which preset a session entry was added under, because the
//     permanent list does not track that either.
//   • main.tsx (not this file) decides WHICH bucket a new entry goes into, by asking store/amnesic
//     (`keepsLookups` of the active preset's Amnesic value) at the moment of the push. It is not
//     decided here so this file stays what every other store in this folder is: state plus
//     setters, with the app owning the one piece of cross-store business logic ("is the active
//     preset on Full right now") the way it already does for Full Reset.

// A saved Lookup history entry — moved verbatim from store/progress (Stage D1 → round 20),
// unchanged: {id, y, m, d, isGap?} and nothing else. It carries only what the user supplied — the
// parsed date, a stable id for selection, and the Oct 5–14, 1582 gap marker. Everything the card
// SHOWS — the formatted label, the weekday(s) — is derived from y/m/d against the LIVE Date Format
// at paint time (components/LookupCard), so a Date Format change re-renders every row and the
// answer slot together rather than leaving an old-format sentence sitting above a new-format row.
export interface LookupEntry {

// Newest to the front — and NOTHING FALLS OFF THE END. The list used to be a window of the 100 most
// recent; the owner's call was to keep every lookup, like every solve time (store/progress).
// THE COST, stated so nobody has to re-derive it: an entry is about 48 characters saved, and the
// list holds one entry per DATE (looking a date up again moves its entry to the front rather than
// adding one — components/LookupCard), so 10,000 different dates is about 480 KB, a tenth of the
// ~5 million characters a browser gives this site. A device that does run out refuses the save
// without breaking anything and tells the player (store/storageHealth), and Clear History is the
// way to make room. On screen the list draws only the rows near the viewport
// (components/scrollRegion's useWindowedRows), so its length costs nothing to scroll.
// ⚠ ONE CAVEAT, accepted: live and staging share this saved copy, so a tab still running a build
// from before this change trims the list back to 100 the next time a lookup is made IN THAT TAB.

// Move an existing entry to the front of ITS OWN list — a re-asked question reads as "the most
// recent one again" without duplicating it. Extracted from main.tsx's inline moveHistoryEntryToTop
// (it used to be written out once, for the one list there was); now there are two lists to apply it
// to — the permanent one and the session-only one — a shared pure function is what keeps the two
// call sites from drifting into two slightly different rewrites of the same array surgery.
export const moveEntryToTop = (prev: LookupEntry[], id: string): LookupEntry[] => {
  const idx = prev.findIndex((e) => e.id === id)

// Merge the permanent list with this session's amnesic-suppressed overflow for DISPLAY. Session
// entries lead: they are always the most recent thing that can have happened relative to whatever
// the permanent list held the moment Amnesic went to Full, since nothing NEW can be prepended to the
// permanent list while the active preset is on Full (that is the whole point of the suppression).
// ⚠ THE ONE ORDERING NUANCE THIS TRADES AWAY, named rather than hidden: if the player leaves an
// amnesic preset mid-session and looks something up from a NON-amnesic one afterwards, that newer
// permanent entry is NOT re-sorted ahead of older session entries by wall-clock time — it lands
// after them here. Getting that exactly right would mean stamping every entry with a timestamp
// purely to compare across the two buckets, which the entry shape above is deliberately without
// (store/progress' own header explains why: inputs only, nothing derived or timestamped). The case
// is rare enough — crossing the amnesic boundary mid-session and then looking something up again —
// that trading it away for a shape with no extra field is the right side of that line.

// The lookup-history normalizer, and the ONLY thing that decides what shape a stored entry has.
// Moved verbatim from store/progress (see that store's git history for the v1→v3 shape story this
// comment used to tell in full) — nothing about the validation changes by moving house.
//
// VALIDATION: the filter asserts exactly what the consumers dereference. LookupCard carries no
// per-field guards of its own — the store owns the shape, so the store has to guarantee it, or a
// truncated/tampered payload reaches the card as {id} alone and renders MONTH[NaN] and a blank
// weekday, or trips the mode error boundary. An entry that can't answer "which date?" has nothing
// to show and is dropped.
//
// The date must also be a REAL one, not merely a number-shaped one — the same either-calendar rule
// Lookup validates with (dimEither): a date counts if it exists in a calendar it can be read in, so
// pre-reform February keeps Julian's 29th, and February 30 or day 32 exists nowhere and is dropped.
// Whole numbers for the same reason: month 1.5 indexes MONTH to `undefined` and day 1.5 produces a
// weekday belonging to no day. Deliberately NOT bounded to Lookup's 1–10000 years: an out-of-range
// year still names a real date and still reads correctly, so there is nothing wrong to drop.
//
// Runs on EVERY rehydrate of EITHER bucket below, not just on a shape upgrade: a payload is read
// from the same untrusted storage whether it is this version or an older one, sessionStorage
// included. Exported for tests.
