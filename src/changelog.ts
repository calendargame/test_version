// changelog.ts — the plain-words changelog (round 6): what each deploy changed, written for
// players, never developers. Hand-maintained: every deploy adds its lines here, a standing part
// of the deploy ritual.
//
// THE CHARTER (round 8; the two ordering rules amended in round 11) — this array is exactly
// what ships and exactly what the popup draws:
//   • Newest first. Entry dates are the deploy's Pacific calendar date in ISO form (YYYY-MM-DD);
//     the popup renders them through the user's Date Format setting, so never encode a format here.
//     ★ THE NEWEST ENTRY'S DATE IS NOW ENFORCED BY THE BUILD (round 16). The deploy stamp is
//     taken from the clock at build time (src/deployStamp.ts), and scripts/changelogStamp.mjs —
//     wired first in vite.config.js's plugin array — FAILS the build unless the entry at the top of
//     this array is dated that stamp's PACIFIC day. So a deploy cannot ship without a changelog
//     entry, and cannot ship one dated a day it did not land on. The two disagree for the 7-8 hours
//     between Pacific midnight and UTC midnight, which is why the guard converts through the IANA
//     zone rather than slicing the stamp's ISO prefix.
//   • ONE entry per Pacific calendar DAY, never per deploy (the round-7 owner call) — so dates
//     stay unique, which is also the popup's per-entry React-key contract (key={en.date});
//     changelog.dom.test pins the uniqueness.
//   • ORDER WITHIN A DAY: MOST NOTICEABLE FIRST, related lines kept adjacent, `Fixed:` lines
//     last. Already the de-facto pattern (the 7/26 entry ends on one), written down in round
//     11. The entry is read top-down by someone who has just been handed the update, so the line
//     likeliest to be why they opened it leads; a fix nobody was waiting for closes.
//   • A SECOND DEPLOY ON THE SAME DAY RESTATES THAT DAY'S NET EFFECT VERSUS PRODUCTION — it does
//     not prepend a second log. (The charter said "prepend, newest lines first" until round
//     11; the practice on 2026-07-28 was already better and is what got codified.) A player only
//     ever sees the difference from the version they last had, so an intermediate state nobody
//     ran is not a change: MERGE a correction into the line it corrects, and DELETE outright a
//     line describing something the later deploy reverted. Worked example, 2026-07-28: round
//     10's hairline fix was merged into round 9's How-to-Play line, and round 9's "Date Format
//     now stacks" line was deleted because round 10 reverted it and no player ever saw it.
//     Lines already SHIPPED on an earlier day are settled history — never reordered or reworded
//     to suit a later rule.
//   • ★ A DEPLOY WITH NOTHING VISIBLE STILL GETS AN ENTRY. The owner's rule, set during round 15
//     and live from round 15 onward; round 16 is the round that finally wrote it HERE, because this
//     charter — not the backlog — is the copy a builder actually reads, and he asked for it to be
//     very, very clear. It is ONE line, and it is this line, VERBATIM, every single time:
//         "Nothing you can see changed this time — just work underneath to keep things running
//          smoothly."
//     WHY IT EXISTS. The GEAR dot fires on ANY build change: the build-stamp detection compares one
//     stamp against another and cannot tell a rewrite from a typo fix. So a purely internal deploy
//     still shows the Updating screen, still lights the gear dot, and still nudges the player to
//     come and read this list. If the newest entry is three days old, the notification pointed at
//     nothing and the app looks broken or dishonest. The player-noticeable rule exists to stop
//     JARGON, not to make the app go silent in the one moment it has just announced itself.
//     ★ AND SINCE 2026-08-10 THIS LINE HAS A SECOND, MECHANICAL JOB — writing it down because it
//     makes the rule harder to talk anyone out of. The CHANGELOG dot is now gated on this array
//     actually gaining something (CHANGELOG_SEEN_KEY below). So on an internal deploy this fallback
//     line IS what makes the breadcrumb honest: with it, the newest entry really is new and the dot
//     truthfully leads somewhere. Skip it and the player gets an Updating screen, a gear dot, and
//     then nothing at all to explain either. The line is no longer just good manners; it is the
//     thing that keeps the trail from breaking.
//     IT IS A FALLBACK, NEVER AN ADDITION. The moment a deploy has one genuinely visible change,
//     this line is DELETED and the real line stands alone. Never both — a real change plus "nothing
//     you can see changed" is a contradiction on the same date, and under the same-day rule above
//     that is exactly what a second deploy on a day that already has real lines would produce, so
//     the merge DROPS this line rather than keeping it.
//     NEVER REWORD IT. Identical every time, so a returning player recognises it at a glance
//     instead of reading it. And never dress it up: "performance improvements and bug fixes" is
//     marketing filler the owner has explicitly rejected, and is usually a lie as well.
//     ⚠ Use it only when there is genuinely nothing else to say. It is not a shortcut for a deploy
//     whose visible change is small or awkward to describe — that one gets described.
//   • TEN entries maximum, ever. When a new day would make it eleven, MOVE the oldest entry to
//     CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md at the repo root (no source file imports it, so retired history costs
//     the bundle nothing) — do not just let the array grow. Before round-8 the popup sliced the
//     latest ten at render time, which meant every day past the tenth was text downloaded by every
//     visitor on every update and then refused; the slice is gone, so an eleventh entry left here
//     would simply PUBLISH itself. changelog.dom.test pins the cap.
// Nothing earlier than the round-5 deploy was ever written down and nothing will be retro-written:
// the history is this array plus whatever has already aged out into the archive.
//
// Alongside the data live the two update-signal dot flags — the breadcrumb that leads a player here
// after an update. ⚠ THEY NO LONGER FIRE TOGETHER (2026-08-10): the build-change detection (in
// main.tsx) marks the GEAR dot on every build change, but marks the CHANGELOG dot only
// when the newest entry here has actually changed since this device last looked — see
// CHANGELOG_SEEN_KEY at the bottom of this file for why, and for the migration case. Opening ⚙
// Settings clears the gear button's dot; the first tap on the Changelog link clears the link's own.
// Plain localStorage, not a store — the flags describe the code that ran, not user data — and
// try/catch throughout: blocked storage (privacy modes) must never break boot, it just means no
// dots.
//
// ★ THIS FILE WRITES localStorage ITSELF, AND SAYS SO EVERY TIME. Every other write in the app goes
// through store/storageHealth — the storage door — and that is how the count of how full the device
// is (store/storageUsage) stays exact. This file cannot call the door: it may import nothing
// (vite.config.js loads it at build time). So the dependency runs the other way. The door hands
// this file one listener (reportWritesTo), and each writer below names the key it has just written
// or removed; the door reads what that key now holds and counts it. Where the door was never
// loaded — the build-time import — there is nobody to tell, and nothing is said.
// ⚠ A NEW WRITER HERE MUST DO THE SAME, on the line after its write. tests/storageDoor pins it.

// useStates and kept the mirror in step by calling setGearDot/setChangelogDot from inside effects —
// which is react-hooks/set-state-in-effect, and the textbook "you might not need an effect" case:
// the state was never a source of truth, only a copy of this one. The fix is to let components read
// the flags directly through useSyncExternalStore, so a write here re-renders every reader with no
// React state and no effect in between.
//
// The listener set is module-scope and process-wide, which is correct: the flags are process-wide
// too. `subscribeUpdateDot` is key-agnostic — a notification wakes every reader and each re-reads
// its own key. With exactly two keys and two readers that is cheaper than tracking subscriptions
// per key, and it cannot go stale when a key is added.
//
// ⚠ EVERY MUTATION OF A DOT FLAG MUST GO THROUGH markUpdateDot/clearUpdateDot. A direct
// localStorage.setItem on one of these keys would change the value without notifying, and the UI
// would not update until something else re-rendered. Verified at the time of writing: these two are
// the only writers in src/ (tests write through them too).

// WHAT THIS DEVICE LAST SAW IN THE CHANGELOG (2026-08-10, the owner's observation on v2.21.1).
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Both dots used to be lit by one line in main.tsx on `buildChanged` alone —
// "this device last booted a different build" — which knows nothing about whether the changelog
// gained anything. So an internal deploy pointed the player at an entry they had already read. It
// is not hypothetical: 2026-08-10 shipped v2.21.0 (two new lines) and then v2.21.1 (an internal
// hardening). Under the charter the day's entry already stated the day's net effect, so v2.21.1
// correctly added nothing — and everyone holding v2.21.0 got a breadcrumb leading nowhere.
//
// ★ THE TWO DOTS MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM WAS LYING. The GEAR dot means "the app
// updated", which is true on every build change and STAYS that way (the owner re-opened that
// question himself and confirmed it): the Updating screen has already fired by then — it cannot be
// suppressed, because the same detection cannot tell a typo fix from a redesign — so removing the
// gear dot would leave the app announcing an update and then behaving as though nothing happened.
// The CHANGELOG dot means "there is something new to READ", and that is what needs gating.
//
// ⚠ THE NEWEST ENTRY ONLY, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Hashing the whole visible list would fire when
// the ELEVENTH day rolls off into CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md (rule 14) — the list would differ while
// nothing new had been added, a false positive. Comparing only the newest entry's DATE would miss
// the opposite case: a second deploy on the same Pacific day ADDING a line to the existing entry,
// which is exactly what v2.21.0 did. So the stamp is the newest entry's date AND its lines.
// ⚠⚠ AND IT IS SOUND ONLY BECAUSE SETTLED HISTORY IS NEVER EDITED — the charter rule above, which
// nothing enforces. A deploy that reworded or added a line to an OLDER entry while leaving the
// newest one byte-identical would be INVISIBLE here: no dot, and the news lost. The build guard
// cannot catch it either (scripts/changelogStamp.mjs inspects only the newest entry's date, and
// structurally cannot see the previous commit's array). So if you are ever tempted to edit a
// shipped entry, this is the consequence: readers who already have that build will never be told.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THE DOT ACTUALLY MEANS, stated because it is not quite "unread". It means "the newest
// entry's text differs from what this device last BOOTED" — the stamp is written at boot, not when
// the changelog is opened. Two knock-on cases, both ACCEPTED: a same-day REWORD that says the same
// thing re-fires, and a same-day DELETION with nothing added re-fires. Both err toward showing a
// dot, which is the same tie-break the migration rule takes below, and a walk of 47 real changelog
// transitions in this repo found the pure-delete-with-nothing-added case has happened zero times.
//
// Stored whole rather than hashed: a few hundred bytes of localStorage costs nothing, and it means
// there is no hash function to be subtly wrong and no collision to reason about. JSON.stringify
// of the array, so the separator question never arises: two entries cannot collide however their
// lines are punctuated, and the stored value stays plain ASCII and legible in devtools.

/**
 * Is there something in the changelog this device has not seen?
 *
 * ⚠⚠ A MISSING STAMP COUNTS AS CHANGED — THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF `buildChanged`, ON PURPOSE, AND THIS
 * IS THE MIGRATION CASE. `buildChanged` treats a missing stamp as "first visit, nothing to announce"
 * because it is the FIRST thing consulted. This is not: it is only ever reached once `buildChanged`
 * has already returned true, which means an installation that has run a DIFFERENT build before —
 * never a first visit. A missing stamp there means only "we have never recorded what this device
 * saw", which is true of every existing installation on the one boot after this ships.
 * ★ So the tie is broken toward SHOWING the dot, because the two errors are not equal: a spurious
 * dot costs a glance, while a suppressed one costs the player the news entirely. The first boot
 * after this change therefore behaves exactly as today does, and every boot after it is honest.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THAT MAKES THIS FUNCTION'S NULL RULE CORRECT ONLY FOR A CALLER THAT HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED
 * THE BUILD CHANGED. `buildChanged` encodes the OPPOSITE null rule in code (lib/buildStamp), so the
 * two comparators genuinely disagree about what a missing value means, and the disagreement is only
 * safe because of the order they run in. Any NEW caller must therefore gate on buildChanged first,
 * exactly as main.tsx does. (Taking that flag as a third parameter was considered, which would turn
 * this paragraph into a unit test; it was not taken because at the sole call site the argument would
 * always be the same variable, and the extra parameter buys nothing a reader of that one line does
 * not already see. Revisit the moment a second caller appears — that is when it starts paying.)
