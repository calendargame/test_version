// changelog.ts — the plain-words changelog (round-6 Q6): what each deploy changed, written for
// players, never developers. Hand-maintained: every deploy adds its lines here, a standing part
// of the deploy ritual.
//
// THE CHARTER (round-8 Q8; the two ordering rules amended round-11 Q6) — this array is exactly
// what ships and exactly what the popup draws:
//   • Newest first. Entry dates are the deploy's Pacific calendar date in ISO form (YYYY-MM-DD);
//     the popup renders them through the user's Date Format setting, so never encode a format here.
//     ★ THE NEWEST ENTRY'S DATE IS NOW ENFORCED BY THE BUILD (round 16, Q1). The deploy stamp is
//     taken from the clock at build time (src/deployStamp.ts), and scripts/changelogStamp.mjs —
//     wired first in vite.config.js's plugin array — FAILS the build unless the entry at the top of
//     this array is dated that stamp's PACIFIC day. So a deploy cannot ship without a changelog
//     entry, and cannot ship one dated a day it did not land on. The two disagree for the 7-8 hours
//     between Pacific midnight and UTC midnight, which is why the guard converts through the IANA
//     zone rather than slicing the stamp's ISO prefix.
//   • ONE entry per Pacific calendar DAY, never per deploy (the round-7 owner call) — so dates
//     stay unique, which is also the popup's per-entry React-key contract (key={en.date});
//     changelog.dom.test pins the uniqueness.
//   • ORDER WITHIN A DAY: MOST NOTICEABLE FIRST, related lines kept adjacent, `Fixed:` lines
//     last. Already the de-facto pattern (the 7/26 entry ends on one), written down in round-11
//     Q6. The entry is read top-down by someone who has just been handed the update, so the line
//     likeliest to be why they opened it leads; a fix nobody was waiting for closes.
//   • A SECOND DEPLOY ON THE SAME DAY RESTATES THAT DAY'S NET EFFECT VERSUS PRODUCTION — it does
//     not prepend a second log. (The charter said "prepend, newest lines first" until round-11
//     Q6; the practice on 2026-07-28 was already better and is what got codified.) A player only
//     ever sees the difference from the version they last had, so an intermediate state nobody
//     ran is not a change: MERGE a correction into the line it corrects, and DELETE outright a
//     line describing something the later deploy reverted. Worked example, 2026-07-28: round
//     10's hairline fix was merged into round 9's How-to-Play line, and round 9's "Date Format
//     now stacks" line was deleted because round 10 reverted it and no player ever saw it.
//     Lines already SHIPPED on an earlier day are settled history — never reordered or reworded
//     to suit a later rule.
//   • ★ A DEPLOY WITH NOTHING VISIBLE STILL GETS AN ENTRY. The owner's rule, set during round 15
//     and live from round 15 onward; round 16 is the round that finally wrote it HERE, because this
//     charter — not the backlog — is the copy a builder actually reads, and he asked for it to be
//     very, very clear. It is ONE line, and it is this line, VERBATIM, every single time:
//         "Nothing you can see changed this time — just work underneath to keep things running
//          smoothly."
//     WHY IT EXISTS. The update dot fires on ANY build change: the build-stamp detection compares
//     one stamp against another and cannot tell a rewrite from a typo fix. So a purely internal
//     deploy still shows the Updating screen, still lights the gear dot, and still nudges the
//     player to come and read this list. If the newest entry is three days old, the notification
//     pointed at nothing and the app looks broken or dishonest. The player-noticeable rule exists
//     to stop JARGON, not to make the app go silent in the one moment it has just announced itself.
//     IT IS A FALLBACK, NEVER AN ADDITION. The moment a deploy has one genuinely visible change,
//     this line is DELETED and the real line stands alone. Never both — a real change plus "nothing
//     you can see changed" is a contradiction on the same date, and under the same-day rule above
//     that is exactly what a second deploy on a day that already has real lines would produce, so
//     the merge DROPS this line rather than keeping it.
//     NEVER REWORD IT. Identical every time, so a returning player recognises it at a glance
//     instead of reading it. And never dress it up: "performance improvements and bug fixes" is
//     marketing filler the owner has explicitly rejected, and is usually a lie as well.
//     ⚠ Use it only when there is genuinely nothing else to say. It is not a shortcut for a deploy
//     whose visible change is small or awkward to describe — that one gets described.
//   • TEN entries maximum, ever. When a new day would make it eleven, MOVE the oldest entry to
//     CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md at the repo root (no source file imports it, so retired history costs
//     the bundle nothing) — do not just let the array grow. Before round-8 the popup sliced the
//     latest ten at render time, which meant every day past the tenth was text downloaded by every
//     visitor on every update and then refused; the slice is gone, so an eleventh entry left here
//     would simply PUBLISH itself. changelog.dom.test pins the cap.
// Nothing earlier than the round-5 deploy was ever written down and nothing will be retro-written:
// the history is this array plus whatever has already aged out into the archive.
//
// Alongside the data live the two update-signal dot flags — the breadcrumb that leads a player
// here after an update: the build-stamp detection (the Q2 effect in main.tsx) marks BOTH on
// every build change, opening ⚙ Settings clears the gear button's dot, and the first tap on the
// Changelog link clears the link's own. Plain localStorage like the build stamp (lib/buildStamp)
// — the flags describe the code that ran, not user data — and try/catch for the same reason:
// blocked storage (privacy modes) must never break boot, it just means no dots.
