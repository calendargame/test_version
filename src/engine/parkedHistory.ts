// engine/parkedHistory.ts — what a casual mode's PARKED HISTORY is, and what comes back from one.
//
// store/sessionHistory keeps a Classic / Deduction / Flash engine in sessionStorage for the browsing
// session and never looks inside it; this file is the other half — the text that is parked, and the
// state that is accepted on the way back. (The same split as store/sessionRound and the mode screens
// for the timed modes' parked rounds.) modes/modeHooks joins the two.
//
// ★ THE TIMES ARE NOT PARKED. They are already saved, in full, in the stats (every solve is kept) —
// tens of thousands of numbers for a long-time player — and the pool is exactly the saved pool, so
// the parked text leaves `stats.times` out and the restore puts the saved one back.
// The times ledger then checks, second by second, that the cards name the pool's tail in play order.
//
// ★ WHAT COMES BACK — NOTHING THAT CANNOT BE CHECKED. A parked history is a claim about the stats
// underneath it, and those stats live somewhere else (store/progress, localStorage — or the session
// copy for an Amnesic preset). So restoreParked accepts a history ONLY if it is exactly the state
// those stats support:
//   • its counts — played, good, streak, best, timesLost — equal the saved ones, and
//   • it comes through the ONE engine restore door (engine/parkedEngine's restoreParkedEngine) with
//     the saved TIMES in place: the shape check, and every engine invariant (engine/invariants — the
//     card ledger, the times ledger in play order, every per-card Override record).
// Anything else comes up fresh from the saved stats, exactly as a mount with nothing parked does. The
// counts can disagree for honest reasons — live and staging were both open in this tab, another tab
// moved a shared preset on — so that is checked FIRST and is not reported; an unreadable blob or an
// invariant break is, because no honest path makes one.
