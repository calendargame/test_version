// engine/invariants.ts — runtime "tripwires": the engine's impossible states.
//
// Pure checks that return a list of violated invariants for a game state (empty =
// healthy). Every check is a TRUE impossibility — a CORRECT engine can never violate
// one — so it is safe to treat a violation as a bug, not a normal edge case.
//
// Used in TWO places, which is the whole point:
//   • PRODUCTION TRIPWIRE — useGameEngine runs checkGameInvariants after every dispatch
//     and reports any violation to Sentry (deduped, prod-only). These bugs DON'T crash —
//     they silently produce a wrong number (an impossible score, a desynced history) —
//     so without this we'd never hear about them on the untestable devices the book
//     brings. Complements the crash reporting: crashes throw, these don't.
//   • FUZZ SURVEY (tests/engine/fuzz) — drives millions of random action sequences and
//     asserts these stay empty, which both hunts for bugs AND proves the tripwires never
//     false-fire (if a check fired during correct play, the fuzz would catch it first).
//
// Why these specific invariants:
//   • Score integrity: `good` can never exceed `played`; a run of credits
//     (`streak`, `best`) can never exceed the total credits (`good`); counts are
//     non-negative integers; `times` are finite, non-negative, and never outnumber the
//     credits that produced them — counting, for a save an old build trimmed, the times it
//     discarded (`timesLost`) beside the ones it kept.
//   • History structure: BACK pushes one forward entry + bumps backDepth, FORWARD undoes
//     exactly that, advance() clears both — so backDepth and forwardStack.length move in
//     lockstep. A mismatch means the Back/Forward bookkeeping desynced.
//   • The CARD LEDGER: every browsable history entry is exactly one increment of `played`. That
//     correspondence is what makes the Q# badge (historyBase + stack.length + 1, see cardNumber) a
//     LIFETIME number rather than a session one, and it is the kind of claim that is easy to argue
//     and easy to break later — so it is asserted here and the fuzz proves it, instead of a comment
//     asserting it. A break means the badge silently disagrees with the Score box beside it.
//   • The TIMES LEDGER: every second in `stats.times` is either carried in (`timesBase` — hydrated
//     from saved progress, or kept across a RESET_ROUND that wiped the history) or is named by
//     exactly one card. That is what lets the run breakdown list the solves one per row and have
//     the rows RECONCILE with the mean printed above them, instead of being a second, independently
//     computed opinion that could quietly drift. And it is exact, ORDER included: the pool is its
//     carried-in times followed by the cards' times in play order — no card names a second the mean
//     does not contain, no second in the mean goes unnamed, and the pool's last entry is the newest
//     solve, which is what every stat strip's "Last" reads (a toggle once broke that — see
//     gameReducer's poolSlot). In a run mode, where timesBase is 0 by construction, the pool IS the
//     cards' times, in order.
//   • The PER-CARD OVERRIDE RECORD: every scored card holds two fixed states, A (as
//     answered) and O (overridden), and its credit is A.credited XOR overridden. A card in O stores
//     its A; if that record and the card it describes ever come apart — the credit not the opposite,
//     the grid not the answer alone, a time on an uncredited state, O not contributing its frozen
//     time, live flags where there is no live card to put them back on, a live card in O not
//     wearing O's fixed flags — a later Undo (or the Override after it) would land somewhere that is
//     neither of the card's two states, which is exactly how a toggle could stack credit or strand a
//     second. And a card the clock timed out on has ONE state only, which no press may leave. So each
//     of those is a tripwire, over every card in play.
//   • The CARD'S CALENDAR: a date before the 1582 reform has two weekdays, and the Julian Calendar
//     setting can change while a date is on screen — so every card that has been judged carries the
//     calendar it was judged in (CardMeta.jul), and everything that shows the card reads that. Three
//     tripwires hold it: a card with anything on its grid has its calendar and a card with an empty
//     grid has none; the answer marked on a grid (and on an overridden card's stored as-answered
//     grid) is the answer IN that calendar — a green its own codes do not arrive at is exactly the
//     defect the stamp exists to end; and a Deduction puzzle's calendar is the one it was built in.
//   • Date/calendar sanity: month 1-12, day 1-31, integer year; a weekday question resolves
//     to an index in 0-6, and a Deduction puzzle's correct answer is actually among its
//     options (correctIndexOf returns -1 if a generator ever produced a puzzle whose answer
//     isn't selectable).

// ── THE CARD'S CALENDAR (tripwires 8–10) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// ⚠ HOT PATH, AND THE ONE PLACE THE WALK REMEMBERS ANYTHING. Working out a date's weekday for every
// card of a thousand-card history after every state change tripled the cost of the whole check (and
// took the fuzz survey's deep-history profile past its limit). But these three read only the card —
// its question, its grid, its record — and the reducer never changes a history entry in place: a
// card that is toggled, browsed to or restored is a NEW object. So an entry that has passed is not
// asked again while it stays where it is; a new or replaced one is asked the first time the walk
// meets it; and a parked blob, whose entries have all just come out of JSON, is checked in full at
// the restore door. checkCalendar returns whether the card passed.
// WHAT IS REMEMBERED: the two history arrays of the last state whose every card passed. An entry is
// skipped when the SAME OBJECT sat at the SAME INDEX of the same array then — one pointer comparison
// per card. That is the whole memory, and it is enough: history only ever changes at an array's end
// (a card played, browsed past, browsed back to) or by one entry being replaced where it stands (a
// toggle), so everything else in the array is still where it was. A walk that finds a fault leaves
// the memory alone, so the fault is reported again on every walk until it is gone. Whenever the
// arrays are not the last ones seen — another mode's engine, the oldest cards forgotten (every
// index shifts), a restore — the cards are simply asked again; it can only ever ask MORE.
// ⚠ NOT A WeakSet OF CHECKED CARDS, which is what this was first. Looking a card up in one was
// cheap; ADDING to it was not — play makes a new entry object every time a card moves, and each one
// went into a weak collection the garbage collector then has to trace. In the app that is nothing.
// In the fuzz survey, which makes about half a million entries per profile, it was a third of
// everything the calendar tripwires added to the deep-history run.
