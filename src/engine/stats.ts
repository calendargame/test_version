// engine/stats.ts — pure time-stat helpers (average / median / last).
//
// One copy, shared by the mode screens' stat strips (modes/modeHooks for Classic / Flash /
// Deduction, and MoX / Blitz directly), engine/aoxBest (a run's Best Mean / Best Median) and
// engine/runBreakdown (the breakdown's summary, which must print the strip's own numbers).
// Pure — no app state, no React. `times` is an array of seconds; all three
// return null on an empty array (rendered as "—" by the formatters).

// ★ THE SOLVE-TIME GRID: every recorded time is a whole number of 0.1 ms (1/10000 s). Round 23
// made the saved times unbounded (every solve is kept), which made their SIZE matter, and a raw time
// was ~17 characters of floating-point noise: performance.now() is clamped to 0.1 ms in Chrome (1 ms
// in Safari and Firefox), but the SUBTRACTION of two clamped readings is not — 126913.4 − 123456.7
// is 3456.699999999997, saved as 3.456699999999997. Snapping the difference back onto the grid the
// browser measured on keeps every digit it actually measured (so nothing a player could see moves)
// and saves "3.4567" — about 7 bytes a time instead of 17.
// ⚠ 0.1 ms, NOT 1 ms, deliberately. The display shows hundredths, so 1 ms would look like plenty —
// but it would throw away real Chrome precision, and a Last (truncated) or Median (rounded) that sits
// within a millisecond of a hundredth boundary would then print a different hundredth than the
// unrounded time does (measured: ~5% of Lasts, ~3.5% of Medians). On 0.1 ms the only thing removed is
// the subtraction noise.
// ⚠ THE UNIT STAYS SECONDS everywhere, including the save. An integer count of 0.1 ms would save one
// byte a time more, and it is not worth it: live and staging share ONE browser origin — one copy of
// the saved data — and a build from before this change would read an integer 34567 as 34,567
// SECONDS and write it back that way. Seconds on the grid read correctly in every build ever shipped.
