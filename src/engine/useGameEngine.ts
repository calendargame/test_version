// engine/useGameEngine.ts — binds the pure gameReducer to React.
//
// The reducer is pure, so this hook owns the impure inputs it can't compute:
//   • new dates — via `genDate` passed in by the parent (exactly like AoxMode
//     receives `genDate={genDate}`), so all the year-range / format / calendar
//     settings stay baked into one place (App's genDate).
//   • solve times — `performance.now()` deltas from a per-question start stamp, snapped onto the
//     0.1 ms grid (engine/stats' solveTimeFromMs).
//
// It returns the engine state, the calendar the card on screen is read in (`julian`) and its
// `correct` answer in that calendar, the Override button's whole state
// (`overrideAvail` = is the press on offer, `overridden` = which word it reads, `overridePlan` = what
// a press would do to which card), and the action callbacks the UI wires to buttons.
//
// Mode-untangle (Stage C, Step 6, sub-step 1c). Classic is the first consumer;
// Flash/Blitz/Deduction pass their own config when they move onto the engine.
//
// useReducer infers `dispatch: Dispatch<GameAction>` from the typed reducer, so
// every dispatch below is checked against the action union (Stage C, TypeScript).
