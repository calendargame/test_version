// engine/gameReducer.ts — the shared game engine as a PURE reducer.
//
// (state, action) => state. No React, no app state, no side effects: the impure
// inputs the original handlers computed inline — the next random date (genDate)
// and solve times (performance.now()) — are supplied by the caller in the action
// payload. Calendar lookups are pure, so the reducer does them directly.
//
// Folding the old App refs into state made every transition atomic, which removed the lazy-mutator +
// stale-setState hazards documented in main.jsx WHILE keeping behavior identical — proven by the
// Classic characterization tests (tests/classic.dom). (The pre-answer stats snapshot App kept is
// gone altogether since round 23: nothing reverses an answer by restoring stats any more — see
// OVERRIDE. The wrong answer's solve time it kept beside it lives on the card, GameState.card.)
//
// This is the engine ALL FIVE modes run on (Classic/Flash/Blitz/Deduction directly;
// AoX via the same hook + a component run/Best layer). The full action set lives here:
// the question loop (NEW/ANSWER/REVEAL/SHOW_CODES/RESET), the OVERRIDE toggle (ONE operation —
// flip the card it points at between "as you answered it" and "overridden", then recompute; see
// the OVERRIDE case), the Back/Forward history nav, the date regen (REGEN_DATE), and the timed-mode
// helpers (RESET_ROUND/LOCK_REVEAL/TIMEOUT_MISS + the ANSWER `complete` / OVERRIDE `hold` flags the
// run modes use).
//
// TYPES (Stage C, TypeScript — the keystone): `GameState` is the full engine state;
// `GameAction` is a discriminated union on `type`, so every `case` is exhaustively
// checked and each action's payload is validated at the dispatch site. A question is a
// discriminated union too — `Question = WeekdayQuestion | DedPuzzle` — which lets
// `correctIndexOf` narrow by `type` with no casts. History entries are `StackEntry`
// (a question plus its answer bookkeeping and its CardMeta).

// browsing or from another preset and Undo there, it shows your original red highlights."

// So the Override state belongs to the QUESTION, permanently, and every scored card has exactly
// two states: A = as you answered it, O = overridden. ★ THE WHOLE RULE IS ONE LINE:
//     credited(card) = A.credited XOR overridden
// and nothing else may ever set a card's credit. An Override on a card in A takes it to O; the same
// button on a card in O (it reads Undo there) takes it back to A. Because the two states are fixed
// values stored on the card, any number of flips lands on one of exactly two positions — a flip
// can never stack credit, never drift a time, and never needs a "used it once" budget (the per-card
// lock the old five-path Override carried is gone for exactly that reason: its only job was to stop
// an incremental delta being applied twice, and a delta read off the card cannot be).
//
// `answered` is stored ONLY while the card is in O — for a card in A the materialised fields
// (StackEntry.btns / hasCredit / solveTime, or the live fields for the card on screen) ARE state
// A, so storing them twice would only make two copies to disagree.
// `live` is the on-screen flags A had; it exists only while the card is the live one (on screen

  // credits so a corrected miss continues the prior run — making Override consistent with the ANSWER
  // path, which already continues the hydrated streak. Both seed at initEngine (0 for a blank/timed
  // start → no behavior change), survive every transition (spread), re-zero on RESET (a fresh
  // initEngine), and RE-BASE on RESET_ROUND, which wipes the history behind the stats it keeps.

  // What `played` was when `stack` was last emptied — so the card being viewed is the
  // (historyBase + stack.length + 1)-th card of this mode's LIFETIME, not the n-th of this session
  // (see cardNumber). The badge sits beside a Score box that a continuous mode HYDRATES at mount
  // while the stack deliberately starts empty, so the old in-session formula and the box next to it
  // had never agreed: 500 cards in, pressing < read "Q1" beside "471/501" (the owner's report).
  // WHY NO NEW PERSISTED DATA IS NEEDED: the engine already keeps an exact 1-to-1 correspondence —
  // every browsable history entry is exactly one increment of `played`. advance() pushes iff the
  // question was answered AND scored (saveStatsThisQ === true), which is precisely the condition
  // under which some stat action already incremented `played` for it; Override moves `good` and
  // never `played`; a card played with Save Stats OFF is neither counted nor pushed; a Blitz
  // per-round timeout (LOCK_REVEAL) shows an answer without scoring it, and is likewise never
  // pushed. So the ONE fact the stack cannot supply is where it started — this field. The
  // correspondence is asserted outright by checkGameInvariants ('card ledger'), so the fuzz proves
  // it across millions of generated games instead of it resting on this paragraph.
  // It seeds at initEngine from the hydrated total (0 for a blank/timed start — which is why
  // Blitz/AoX, whose Begin/Reset is a full RESET, are unchanged BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by a
  // special case), re-zeroes on RESET with the stats it clears, and re-bases to the KEPT `played`
  // on RESET_ROUND (the timed modes' mid-round Reset wipes history but keeps lifetime stats).
  historyBase: number
  // ── The TIMES ledger (what makes the run breakdown a proof rather than a second opinion) ─────
  // `stats.times` is a bare pool of seconds: it says WHAT the mean is made of and nothing about
  // WHICH card contributed each number. That was survivable while the only consumers were
  // calcAvg/calcMed, and it stopped being survivable the moment a screen had to list the solves
  // one per row — a solve rescued by Override keeps its time in the mean while its own row had no
  // way to know, so the rows would silently fail to add up to the headline they sit under.
  //
  // So every card now carries the time it is contributing RIGHT NOW (StackEntry.solveTime), and
  // this field is that same fact for the card in `state.date` — the one card that is not in a
  // stack. Together they are a complete, per-card decomposition of the pool: every path that
  // pushes a time into `stats.times` writes it here or onto an entry, and every path that drops
  // one clears it in the same transition. checkGameInvariants asserts the two sides agree, so the
  // fuzz proves the decomposition across millions of games instead of it resting on this comment.
  //
  // `timesBase` is the count of times that sit BEHIND the current history with no card to name
  // them — exactly the role `historyBase` plays for `played`, and it exists for the same two
  // reasons: a continuous mode HYDRATES saved `times` on mount with no history behind them, and
  // RESET_ROUND wipes the history while keeping the stats. So the standing claim is
  // `times.length === timesBase + (the ledger's non-null entries)`, and the ledger times are
  // always a sub-multiset of the pool. When `timesBase` is 0 — which is every run/round mode, whose
  // Begin is a full RESET — those two together force EXACT equality, which is the property the

//               target falls through to the card before it.
//   'retro'   — otherwise the most recent history card, with the live card untouched: a fresh date
//               is on screen and the card you just finished is the one Override means.
//   null      — nothing to point at (a fresh mode with no history): the button is dimmed.
// ★ A TIMED-OUT CARD (CardMeta.timedOut) IS NEVER THE TARGET, WHEREVER IT SITS — the clock running
// out is not a misclick (owner decision, round 23). Live, it falls through to the card before it as
// above. As the newest history card, or browsed to, the button has nothing to point at (a timed-out
// card leaves the live edge only through a New, which the Blitz round it ends never offers — so those

// was LIVE, resting on flags the card sheds when it becomes history (second review round, F5).

// which an OVERRIDE does not carry — and it is a presentation rule, not an integrity one. Every card
// this selector can return was SCORED (a browsed or retro card is history, and history is scored by
// construction — see GameState.historyBase; a live target needs saveStatsThisQ === true), so a press
