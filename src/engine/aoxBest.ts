// engine/aoxBest.ts — pure Best-record reconciliation for AoX (the component wrapper layer).
//
// AoX keeps a per-config Best Mean / Best Median record — the FASTEST run a config has produced.
// "Best" here means MINIMUM time (lower is better), the opposite of Blitz's maximum score. A run records
// its Best on completion (the Nth credited solve); a post-completion Override that undoes that solve
// rolls the Best back. The record holds, for EACH of the two metrics, the metric value PLUS its
// companion stat (avgMed = the median of the run that set the best average; medAvg = the average of the
// run that set the best median) and the run id that set it — so the two metrics can come from DIFFERENT
// runs and each carries the matching stats from its own run.
//
// RECONCILE is continuous, like Blitz's. An ended run's history stays browsable and overridable, so
// a press of the Override ⇄ Undo button can retract one of the run's n credited solves (on a browsed
// card, on the card behind the live one, or on the held completing solve) or add a credit back — any
// number of times, in either direction — so the run's standing stats keep moving after the
// completion recorded the Best. So AoxMode snapshots the ENTIRE pre-run Best record at Begin
// (the cumulative best of every PRIOR run — the floor that can never be lost, the cross-run
// corner the Blitz cross-round rollback fix had to add; `undefined` when the config had no record) and, on every
// stats change of a run that counts, sets the record to reconcileAoxStanding(snapshot, standing stats):
// still standing (good ≥ n) → the snapshot improved by the run's CURRENT avg/median; no longer
// standing (a credit was retracted) → the snapshot unchanged, as if the run never completed — which,
// for a config that had no record, is NO RECORD (the key is removed, exactly as Blitz does:
// engine/bestMap). That subsumes the old undo-the-completing-solve rollback
// and closes the back-browse hole (before the fix, only the live-edge reversal rolled the Best back,
// so a back-browse un-credit left a FABRICATED Best standing on a run with fewer than n credits).
// Extracted from main.tsx so it can be fuzzed directly against an independent oracle (best == the
// min avg/median among standing runs, compared and stored at DISPLAY precision — see the ★ comments
// on reconcileAoxBest below for why raw-float comparison was a bug, not a simplification). Pure — no
// React, no app state. Mirrors engine/blitzBest.ts.

// Fold a completed run's (avg, med) into the Best record, tagged `rid`. Each metric improves only on a
// STRICT decrease (a faster time), so the FIRST run to reach a given minimum keeps the record (and its
// companion stat) — a later run that merely ties does not displace it. Returns the next record; a
// metric that improved is the one now tagged with `rid`, which is exactly what the "new best ★"
// marker reads (engine/roundId's isNewBest — the ★ is derived from the ids, so this no longer
// reports a separate improved-flag pair). The caller snapshots the PRE-call `cur` for rollback
// (restore-on-undo), so this stays a pure forward fold.
//
// ★ COMPARE AT DISPLAY PRECISION, NOT RAW FLOAT PRECISION. Best Mean / Best Median / Mean / Median are
// NEVER shown to the player except through fmtTime (modeFormat.ts), which rounds to hundredths via
// roundCentis (WCA reg 9f1). So two runs can print IDENTICALLY — "2.13s" and "2.13s" — while their raw
// avg/med floats differ in the fourth-plus decimal (calcAvg/calcMed divide sums, which is where that
// noise comes from). A raw `avg < cur.avg` still fires on that invisible difference and hands the
// record (and with it the ★) to a "new best" no player can ever see or verify — that was the actual bug here, not the strict-`<`
// tie rule itself (a genuine full-precision tie correctly not counting as an improvement is correct
// and unchanged). roundCentis is imported from modeFormat rather than reimplemented: that file's own
// comment explains in detail why a second `Math.round(t * 100)` would silently disagree with it on a
// boundary case like 59.995, and two rounding implementations that can disagree with EACH OTHER is
// exactly the bug class this codebase's comments repeatedly warn against.
//
// ★ STORAGE follows the same reasoning one step further. Once a run improves the record, `next.avg` /
// `next.med` store the ROUNDED value (roundCentis(..)/100), not the raw float — and so do the
// companion stats avgMed/medAvg, which are displayed through fmtTime too. This app's whole philosophy
// is that a stat means exactly what's printed and carries no hidden state (see modeFormat.ts's EM_DASH
// block for the same principle applied to the dash); a persisted Best that is secretly MORE precise
// than anything a player could ever compare it against is exactly the kind of ghost precision that
// philosophy rules out, and it's also what would let a future raw compare reintroduce this same bug.
// This doesn't cost the NEXT comparison anything: roundCentis is idempotent on its own output — for
// every whole-hundredth value in range, centis/100 round-trips through it to the identical centis
// (verified 0..60000s, i.e. every WCA-legal single/average) — so once a value is stored rounded, every
// future compare is exact centis-integer vs. centis-integer and can never itself drift.
