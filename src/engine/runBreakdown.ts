// engine/runBreakdown.ts — an ended run/round, solve by solve.
//
// Pure: (GameState, the Julian Calendar setting) => the ordered list of cards that were PLAYED,
// each with the date it asked, the weekday that date fell on, the second it is contributing to the
// mean, and whether it earned its point — plus the summary line the popup prints above them
// (components/RunBreakdown). No React, no app state, no formatting; the caller owns every string.
//
// ★ A FAILED MoX RUN IS A RUN LIKE ANY OTHER HERE (round 22). Nothing in this file ever asked how the
// run ended: the walk below reads the stacks and the live card, and a run that failed on a wrong
// answer, a Reveal, a Show Codes or a failing Override leaves those in exactly the shape the ledger
// arguments describe — the failing card took its `played` increment at the action that failed it,
// so it is a row, marked, and untimed. tests/engine/runBreakdown pins each failure path.
//
// ★ THE SUMMARY IS COMPUTED FROM THE ROWS, and that is the whole design, not an implementation
// detail. The obvious alternative — print `calcAvg(state.stats.times)` at the top and list the rows
// underneath — makes the headline agree with the stats strip BY CONSTRUCTION while leaving it free
// to disagree with the rows directly beneath it, which is the one contradiction a player would
// actually catch. Deriving both from the same array makes the panel internally consistent by
// construction instead, and moves the remaining claim — "these rows ARE the mean on the strip" —
// somewhere it can be enforced: the times ledger (StackEntry.solveTime + GameState.liveSolveTime),
// which checkGameInvariants asserts after every dispatch and the fuzz proves across millions of
// games. So the breakdown is a live proof of the headline rather than a second opinion about it.
//
// ⚠ WHAT MAKES THE ROWS COMPLETE — worth stating because it is the same argument the card ledger
// makes for the Q# badge, and it is what keeps this file from needing any state of its own. Every
// browsable history entry is exactly one increment of `played`, so walking the history in order and
// keeping the cards that were COUNTED yields exactly `played` rows. The one card the stacks cannot
// supply is the one on screen, which is why `state.date` is spliced in at its position rather than
// appended: browsing back POPS cards off `stack` and parks them in `forwardStack`, so mid-browse the
// on-screen card sits BETWEEN the two.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THE ROWS DO NOT KNOW, stated plainly rather than guessed at. A missed card can say THAT it
// was missed and, from its own answer grid, which of three shapes the miss had — you picked a wrong
// day, the answer was shown to you, or an Override took the credit back. It cannot say whether "the
// answer was shown" was a Reveal, a Show Codes, or a Blitz timeout: those three write byte-identical
// records (a lone green, nothing else), and the engine records no reason. Inventing a fourth field to
// separate them was considered and REJECTED for now — it would be a new per-question field threaded
// through the five Override paths, which is where this app's hardest bugs have always lived, bought
// for a distinction the panel never claimed to make. So the mark says exactly what is known: `shown`
// means "the answer was on screen", and the guide says the same. If the distinction is ever wanted,
// it is a per-question `missKind` set at REVEAL / SHOW_CODES / TIMEOUT_MISS and carried by advance()
// exactly the way `solveTime` is — the ledger built here is the pattern to copy.
