// Real-user error reporting (Current Work C1) — Sentry, PRODUCTION + STAGING ONLY.
//
// Why this shape:
//  • ErrorBoundary (whole-app) + ModeErrorBoundary (per-mode) already CATCH crashes and show a
//    graceful recover card. This adds the missing half — telling us a crash happened on devices we
//    can't test (the book will send readers on a huge range of old/weak phones). The boundaries call
//    captureError() from componentDidCatch.
//  • LAZY-LOADED: the heavy SDK lives in ./sentryClient, pulled in via a dynamic import() as its OWN
//    chunk, so it never blocks first paint (most important on the weak devices we want to support). A
//    tiny eager pair of window handlers + a bounded queue buffer any errors that fire BEFORE the SDK
//    finishes loading (e.g. an early incompatibility crash on a slow device — exactly what we most
//    want to hear about), then flush once it is ready. The SDK installs its own global handlers, so
//    ours are removed on load to avoid double-reporting.
//  • PRIVACY-FIRST + LEAN: errors only — see ./sentryClient (no Session Replay, no Tracing,
//    sendDefaultPii:false) and the __SENTRY_* tree-shake flags in vite.config.js.
//  • DEPLOYED BUILDS ONLY, and that takes TWO gates because no single flag distinguishes them:
//    main.tsx calls initObservability() behind import.meta.env.PROD (so `vite dev` never reports),
//    and initObservability() itself refuses on a loopback host (see LOOPBACK_HOSTS — a locally
//    SERVED build is import.meta.env.PROD too, so the build-time flag alone was not enough).
//    Deployed staging (calendargame.app/test_version/) still reports, tagged environment:'staging'
//    (set in ./sentryClient), so we can verify it + catch bugs before prod.
type Reporter = (error: unknown, context?: Record<string, unknown>) => void

// Bound the pre-load buffer so a crash loop before the SDK arrives can't grow memory without limit.
const MAX_BUFFERED = 20

// Hosts that mean "this build is being SERVED locally", never a deployment. `vite preview` (and any
// headless run against it) serves a real production build, so import.meta.env.PROD is true there and
// main.tsx's build-time gate lets it through. It then reports into the REAL project — and because the
// environment tag is derived from the URL PATH (staging is the /test_version/ subpath of the same
// host), a loopback URL matches neither the live root nor staging and files as 'staging', polluting
// the exact data we read to check a deploy. So a local preview must not start reporting at all.
// LOOPBACK ONLY, deliberately: a deployed build is only ever served from calendargame.app, so this
// list can never silence a real one. ('[::1]' is what URL parsing yields for IPv6 loopback, brackets
// included; a bare LAN IP is out of scope — nothing serves this app that way.)
