// CustomSelect — the app's custom dropdown, replacing the native <select>.
//
// Renders a trigger button; when open, the option list is PORTALED to #root so
// it escapes any clipping/overflow ancestor (e.g. the scrollable Settings
// popover) and floats over the page, positioned FIXED against the viewport.
// Full listbox keyboard support (↑/↓/Home/End/Enter/Space/Esc/Tab) and a
// click-outside-to-close handler that correctly treats taps inside the portaled
// panel (and on native scrollbars) as "inside".
//
// ⚠ CALLER CONTRACT (Q8, round 11) — THE TRIGGER MUST LIVE IN FIXED CHROME. The panel is
// position:fixed and is measured from the trigger's viewport rect on open; nothing re-measures it
// while a scroller moves, by design. The app's one call site is the mode selector in the fixed top
// bar, which no scroller can move. A future call site inside a SCROLLING region needs repositioning
// WRITTEN AND TESTED against that real case — do not assume it, and do not restore a general
// "reposition on any scroll" branch on spec: this component had one, it was provably unexercisable
// (one live instance, trigger in fixed chrome), and re-measuring mid-scroll is exactly what
// produced the momentum jitter Q8 removed.
//
// ⚠ IT ALSO DEPENDS ON html / body / #root DECLARING NO CONTAINING BLOCK. A transform, filter,
// backdrop-filter, will-change, contain or perspective on any of those three would turn the
// "viewport" this panel is fixed to into a scrolling box and silently bring the drift back.
// tests/containingBlockGuard.test.js fails the build if one ever appears.
//
// ⚠ DISMISS RULE — A SCROLL DOES NOT CLOSE THIS MENU, and that is a decision, not an omission
// (owner's call, 2026-08-07). What closes it: choosing an option, a touch/mouse press OUTSIDE it,
// Escape, Tab, and Android Back. A document scroll does nothing at all.
//
// WHY, because two shipped designs died proving it. The old rule closed on a scroll the user
// STARTED while the menu was open, but not on one that was already gliding when it opened — a
// distinction that has to be drawn from the timing of scroll events, and iOS will not support one.
// Two mechanisms (a `scrollend` boundary, then a measured gap between scroll events) each passed in
// Chromium and each FAILED on the owner's iPhone. The root cause of the harder half was never a
// timing bug at all: WebKit SUPPRESSES the entire touch sequence of a tap that interrupts momentum
// deceleration (UIKitUtilities' _wk_isInterruptingDeceleration — no touchstart, no pointerdown, no
// click), deliberately, since ~2017, with no `touch-action` opt-out. So a tap on a coasting page
// cannot open this menu on ANY design, which is exactly the iOS convention every native app follows:
// the first tap stops the page, the second one opens the menu.
// Given that, the owner chose to give up scroll-dismissal outright rather than keep a rule that can
// only be approximated. It costs nothing visually: the trigger lives in the FIXED top bar (the
// caller contract above), so a page scrolling under an open panel leaves the panel exactly where it
// belongs — glued under its own trigger — instead of drifting away from it.
// tests/customselect pins the non-dismissal; tests/scrollEndGuard keeps the `scrollend` route shut.
//
// The panel always opens DOWNWARD. The auto-flip-up branch was deleted in round 11 (Q8): at the
// only call site the space above is structurally negative (measured −45px against a 325px panel —
// the trigger is IN the bar the flip measured its ceiling from), so the branch could not run, and
// once the panel is fixed its `bottom` offset would have had to be re-derived against a different
// box — an untestable edit to unreachable code. A future call site that genuinely needs to flip
// should have it written against that case.
//
// ⚠ STABILITY NOTE: the portal positioning (measurePanel) was tuned against iOS Safari over
// several attempts and is QA-confirmed working. It looks like ordinary geometry but is
// device-sensitive — ALWAYS re-verify on iPhone Safari (browser + PWA) after editing anything here.
