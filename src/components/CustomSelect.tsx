// CustomSelect — the app's custom dropdown, replacing the native <select>.
//
// Renders a trigger button; when open, the option list is PORTALED to #root so
// it escapes any clipping/overflow ancestor (e.g. the scrollable Settings
// popover) and floats over the page, positioned FIXED against the viewport.
// Full listbox keyboard support (Enter/Space to open; ↑/↓/Home/End/Enter/Esc/Tab once open) and a
// press-outside-to-close handler that correctly treats taps inside the portaled
// panel (and on native scrollbars) as "inside".
//
// AN OPEN LIST IS A LAYER in the app's stack of open things (components/overlayStack), which is
// where Escape, Android Back and a press outside are decided: each closes the TOP layer only. So
// with the ⚙ panel's "Open in" list open, one Escape or one tap outside closes the list and leaves
// the panel, and a second closes the panel.
// …AND IT COVERS THE PAGE while it is open (the stack's "THE KEYBOARD'S REACH"): the keyboard stays
// on the trigger, which drives the list, and no page key acts behind it — the game's keys and
// Lookup's used to, while this list's own arrows were moving its cursor.
//
// NOTHING IN THE LIST WEARS A FOCUS RING, in the top bar or in the ⚙ menu. The keyboard's cursor
// in an open list is the soft grey box on the option it has reached — the same box a mouse resting
// on an option gets — and that is the whole of it: the frosted lists look exactly as they always
// have. The ring (index.css, "THE KEYBOARD FOCUS RING") is drawn where the real focus is, which is
// the trigger, and only for a trigger inside a ring scope ("Open in").
//
// ⚠ CALLER CONTRACT (round 11; widened by round 23) — THE TRIGGER MUST NOT MOVE WHILE THE
// PANEL IS OPEN. The panel is position:fixed and is measured from the trigger's viewport rect on
// open; nothing re-measures it while a scroller moves, by design — re-measuring mid-scroll is
// exactly what produced the momentum jitter round 11 removed, and a general "reposition on any
// scroll" branch must not come back on spec. There are two ways a call site meets the contract:
//   • ITS TRIGGER LIVES IN FIXED CHROME, which no scroller can move — the top bar's mode selector
//     and preset switcher.
//   • ITS TRIGGER LIVES INSIDE A SCROLL REGION, AND THIS COMPONENT HOLDS THAT REGION STILL for as
//     long as the panel is open (components/scrollRegion's holdScrollRegion) — the ⚙ panel's
//     "Open in" (round 23), the first call site of this kind, written and tested against that
//     real case as this paragraph used to require of whoever came first. Holding the region still
//     was chosen over following the trigger for three reasons: it cannot jitter, because nothing is
//     re-measured; it stops an iOS momentum glide that was already running when the menu opened (a
//     tap does reach a trigger on an INNER scroller that is still coasting — see the round-13 note
//     below — and following that glide is exactly the per-frame re-measure refused above); and it
//     keeps the trigger from sliding out from under its own panel and behind the region's clipped
//     edge, which following it could not prevent.
//
// ⚠ IT ALSO DEPENDS ON html / body / #root DECLARING NO CONTAINING BLOCK. A transform, filter,
// backdrop-filter, will-change, contain or perspective on any of those three would turn the
// "viewport" this panel is fixed to into a scrolling box and silently bring the drift back.
// tests/containingBlockGuard.test.js fails the build if one ever appears.
//
// ⚠ DISMISS RULE — A SCROLL DOES NOT CLOSE THIS MENU, and that is a decision, not an omission
// (owner's call, 2026-08-07). What closes it: choosing an option, a touch/mouse press OUTSIDE it,
// Escape, Tab, and Android Back. A scroll of any kind does nothing at all.
//
// WHY, because two shipped designs died proving it. The old rule closed on a scroll the user
// STARTED while the menu was open, but not on one that was already gliding when it opened — a
// distinction that has to be drawn from the timing of scroll events, and iOS will not support one.
// Two mechanisms (a `scrollend` boundary, then a measured gap between scroll events) each passed in
// Chromium and each FAILED on the owner's iPhone. The root cause of the harder half was never a
// timing bug at all: WebKit SUPPRESSES the entire touch sequence of a tap that interrupts momentum
// deceleration (UIKitUtilities' _wk_isInterruptingDeceleration — no touchstart, no pointerdown, no
// click), deliberately, since ~2017, with no `touch-action` opt-out. That is the iOS convention
// every native app follows: the first tap stops the page, the second one opens the menu.
// Given that, the owner chose to give up scroll-dismissal outright rather than keep a rule that can
// only be approximated. It costs nothing visually: the trigger lives in the FIXED top bar (the
// caller contract above), so a page scrolling under an open panel leaves the panel exactly where it
// belongs — glued under its own trigger — instead of drifting away from it.
// tests/customselect pins the non-dismissal; tests/scrollEndGuard keeps the `scrollend` route shut.
//
// ⚠ THE SUPPRESSION IS ABOUT THE MAIN SCROLL VIEW, NOT ABOUT TAPS — a correction round 13 earned,
// and the reason that round happened. The paragraph above used to end "so a tap on a coasting page
// cannot open this menu on ANY design", and the owner disproved it on his own device, unprompted,
// by comparing the guide against the app's inner scrollers: fling an INNER scroll region, lift, and
// press this trigger while it is still coasting, and the menu opens first try while the region
// finishes gliding. _wk_isInterruptingDeceleration guards the WKWebView's own main scroll view; an
// overflow:auto box coasting under a position:fixed bar is not it. How to Play was the app's only
// screen scrolling the document, which is why it was the only screen this bit — and it now scrolls
// the same inner container as everything else (src/main.tsx, `switchMode`). What survives untouched
// is the dismiss rule itself: it was the right call for its own reasons, and re-deriving a timing
// rule on top of a platform that never needed one is not on the table.
//
// The panel always opens DOWNWARD. The auto-flip-up branch was deleted in round 11: at what was
// then the only call site, the mode selector, the space above is structurally negative (measured
// −45px against a 325px panel — the trigger is IN the bar the flip measured its ceiling from), so
// the branch could not run, and once the panel is fixed its `bottom` offset would have had to be
// re-derived against a different box — an untestable edit to unreachable code. There are three
// call sites now — the mode selector and the preset switcher in the bar, and "Open in" at the top
// of the ⚙ panel — and none has room above it either; a long list scrolls inside the panel instead
// (the maxHeight on the panel below). A future call site that genuinely needs to flip should have
// it written against that case.
//
// ⚠ STABILITY NOTE: the portal positioning (measurePanel) was tuned against iOS Safari over
// several attempts and is QA-confirmed working. It looks like ordinary geometry but is
// device-sensitive — ALWAYS re-verify on iPhone Safari (browser + PWA) after editing anything here.

//   • 'at-least-trigger' — the two preset lists. NEVER NARROWER THAN THE TRIGGER, AND AS WIDE AS
//     ITS LONGEST NAME NEEDS. A list the exact width of its trigger cannot show what the trigger
//     shows: a row spends width the trigger does not (the ✓ column, wider padding, a larger text
//     tier), so its name cell is the narrower of the two — and a preset's name is allowed to be
//     exactly as long as the TRIGGER can display (lib/presetNameWidth), so every name near that
//     length was cut short with "…" in the very list you pick it from. So the list takes the width
//     its names ask for, with the trigger's width as its floor (short names: the same box as
//     before, to the pixel — which holds only because a label holds no width of its own open in
//     the list; components/openListContext is how the preset name cell knows to let go of its). It is pinned by its LEFT edge and grows to the right, because that is
//     where the room is: the preset switcher sits at the left of the bar, a few dozen pixels from
//     the screen's edge. It stops one gutter short of the right edge of the screen; a name longer
