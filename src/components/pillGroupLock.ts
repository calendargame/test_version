// The ⚙ Settings picker LOCK, published by a PillGroup (components/PillGroup) and read by the
// PillTray segments inside it (components/PillTray). One boolean is the whole lock: the group's

// derive from it, so a locked picker can never be locked three ways out of four.

// Its own module because the two components that share it are two modules, and a context is
// neither of them — a component file that also exports a hook breaks Fast Refresh for that file
// (react-refresh/only-export-components), which is the rule's point rather than its pedantry.
//
// The default is false: a tray outside any group is simply live.
