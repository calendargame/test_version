// PresetSwitcher — the control that says which preset you are on and moves you to another one.
//
// ★★ IT IS A CustomSelect, NOT A NEW CONTROL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SPECIFICATION. The owner's
// words about the mode selector's press-drag ("swipe down") gesture: *"that's genuinely one of the
// most convenient parts of the whole site."* So this control reuses components/CustomSelect with
// `pressDrag` and inherits that gesture, its keyboard model, its Android-Back handling and its
// portaled panel wholesale.
// ⚠ WHY REUSE IS A HARD REQUIREMENT RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE, and it is the most expensive lesson
// in this component's history: that gesture FAILED TWICE on the owner's iPhone (round 11 cases
// A and B) while passing in Chromium every time, and was cured in round 12 only by DELETING the
// close-on-scroll logic outright — the platform reason is written out at the top of CustomSelect.
// A second control with its own gesture would be a second chance to re-derive that bug. Nothing in
// this file touches CustomSelect's gesture handling; it passes `pressDrag` and gets out of the way.
//
// ⚠ AND IT SATISFIES CustomSelect's CALLER CONTRACT ONLY IN FIXED CHROME. The panel is
// position:fixed and measured ONCE per open, from the trigger's viewport rect, and nothing
// re-measures it while a scroller moves. This control is designed for the fixed top bar, beside the
// mode selector. Mounting it inside a SCROLLING region would need repositioning written and tested
// against that case first — see the contract at the top of CustomSelect, which says so at length.
//
// ── ⚠⚠ WHAT MOUNTING THIS OWES, and it is not just placing the element ────────────────────────
// Written here rather than left to be rediscovered, because both items are invisible until they
// are wrong and neither has a test that can notice on its own:
//   • THE ⚙ CLICK-OUTSIDE HANDLER (src/main.tsx) MUST LEARN ABOUT THIS TRIGGER. It closes the
//     settings popover on any press outside three regions, one of which is the mode selector's
//     wrapper (`modeSelectRef`) — and that exclusion is exactly why pressing the mode trigger with
//     the panel open opens the menu instead of slamming the panel shut underneath the gesture.
//     A generic `[role="listbox"]` clause already covers the open PANEL of any select, so only the
//     TRIGGER is uncovered. The fix is the same shape: give this control a `wrapperRef` prop
//     forwarded to CustomSelect's own `wrapperRef`, and add it to that handler's exclusions.
//     ✔ BOTH DONE by the top-bar rebuild, which is the change that mounts this: the prop is
//     declared below (and is REQUIRED, not optional — an exclusion a caller can silently forget is
//     the bug it exists to prevent), App passes `presetSelectRef`, and that ref is now the handler's
//     fourth exclusion. tests/topBar.dom pins the behaviour, not the wiring: press this trigger with
//     the ⚙ panel open and the panel must still be open.
//   • RULE 4: How to Play documents everything observable, and this control puts a new observable
//     thing on screen — the switcher itself — and a new audible one, the spoken ", amnesic".
//     ✔ DONE: GuidePage's "Presets" section (Interface), plus the Accessibility bullets that name
//     this control and what it says of an amnesic preset.
//
// ── THE ONE THING THIS CONTROL DOES DIFFERENTLY FROM THE MODE SELECTOR ────────────────────────
//
// ★ IT MUST NOT SIZE ITSELF TO ITS LONGEST OPTION. CustomSelect's trigger renders EVERY option
// stacked in a one-cell grid (all but the selected one `invisible`), so its width is the width of
// the widest label. For a fixed list of seven mode names that is exactly right — the control is as
// wide as it needs to be and never moves. For PRESET names, sizing to content is wrong from BOTH
// directions: the names are PLAYER-TYPED, so a shrink-to-fit trigger would resize itself under the
// player's thumb on every rename, and (before round 20) a long enough name would permanently
// widen the top bar for as long as that preset existed.
//
// ★★ ROUND 20 CHANGED WHO GIVES, AND PRESET_NAME_COL WITH IT. Rounds 18-19 fixed the width this cell
// bore so it could never widen the bar; round 20 gave this control FIRST CLAIM on the bar's own
// slack instead — main.tsx's row puts `flex-1 min-w-0` on THIS control alone, and every other
// control keeps `shrink-0` (see the budget block above the bar's markup there for the arithmetic
// and why the switcher is the one that gives). PRESET_NAME_COL followed the same turn: it went
// from the ONE fixed width every option's name cell wore to a MINIMUM one, applied via `minWidth`
// rather than `width` below. Everything that used to make the cell exactly PRESET_NAME_COL wide
// now makes it AT LEAST that wide, and the rest is ordinary block-fill: this cell
// (`display:flex`, no width of its own) sits inside a chain of boxes that each default to 100% of
// their own parent once something upstream hands them a definite size to fill — the trigger's
// `w-full` below is that upstream size, and CustomSelect's grid, its grid-item cells, and this
// cell each just inherit it one layer at a time. NOTHING IN CustomSelect NEEDED TO CHANGE for
// that half of the chain — its className is entirely this file's to set, which is the whole
// reason `w-full` on the trigger below is enough on its own.
//   ⚠ THE ONE PLACE CustomSelect DID need a matching change is the DROPDOWN rows, which are a
//   structurally different flex row (not the trigger's stacked grid) and would NOT have picked up
//   the same fill by construction — see that file's option-row rendering for the fix and why it
//   was needed once this cell stopped being a fixed constant.
//   THE FLOOR STAYS as the TRIGGER-GRID floor and a defensive one. The portaled panel is
//   `dropdownWidth="at-least-trigger"` — never narrower than this trigger's live rendered width,
//   and wider when its longest name needs it — so a menu row always has something to fill (the
//   label cell is `flex-1` of a `w-full` row of that panel), and PRESET_NAME_COL rarely binds
//   in the menu. It still binds in the trigger's own stacked grid, and it is still the
//   thing that stops a name cell collapsing toward bare content if the trigger is ever squeezed
//   toward its own minimum — kept as a "never smaller than this" rather than an "always exactly
//   this". `em`, not px or rem, for the reason it always was: the root font-size is FLUID
//   (index.css's clamp), so a px floor would be a fixed number of pixels holding a variable number
//   of characters, and `em` keeps the floor a fixed number of CHARACTERS at every root size
//   instead — the same PRESET_NAME_COL floor is roomier in the dropdown's larger text tier than
//   in the trigger's `text-sm` automatically, with no second constant.
//
// ⚠ NOTE WHAT IS *STILL NOT CONSTRAINED* BY THE BAR: the portaled dropdown panel. It is an overlay
// (`position:fixed`) that answers to the viewport, not to the bar — at least as wide as this
// trigger, as wide as its longest name asks, and stopped one gutter short of the screen's right
// edge (CustomSelect's panelBox) — so nothing it does can widen the bar.
//
// ⚠⚠ TWO MECHANISMS STILL BOUND A NAME, BUT THEY NO LONGER AGREE BY CONSTRUCTION THE WAY TWO FIXED
// CONSTANTS DID. store/presets' MAX_PRESET_NAME is now a generous, DEVICE-INDEPENDENT ceiling for
// names this app never watched get typed — a stored payload, an old build, a tampered value (the
// full argument is at that constant). The cap that actually governs ordinary TYPING is measured
// LIVE, against THIS control's own rendered cell, and lives one level up from either file: see
// lib/presetNameWidth. `PRESET_NAME_CELL_SELECTOR`, exported below beside PRESET_NAME_COL, is the
// DOM hook that measurement reads — components/PresetManager's rename field is mounted in a
// completely different part of the tree (a ⚙ modal, not the fixed top bar), so it cannot reach
// this cell through React props or context; it reads the live element the same way this app
// already reaches across an unrelated component boundary elsewhere (the game's `[data-key="..."]`
// shortcuts, the answer grid's `[data-answer-grid]`).
//
// ── WHAT A PRESET LIST SAYS OF AN AMNESIC PRESET ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ★ NOTHING IS DRAWN, AND SOMETHING IS SPOKEN. A preset's row used to carry a small "A" after its
// name; the owner dropped it (an arbitrary letter, and it cost every amnesic preset part of its
// name's width — "it doesn't make sense to require names to be shorter for amnesic presets"). What
// is temporary is marked on the page itself instead, where the numbers are: the dashed outline
// (index.css's .session-only) on the stats strip, and on the Best readouts under Full. So a row is
// its name and nothing else, and the name has the whole cell.
// ★ A SCREEN READER STILL HEARS IT, for every preset in the list and not only the one you are on —
// the outline is on the screen you are looking at, and a list is where you choose where to go:
//     Full        "Weekend, amnesic"
//     Stats Only  "Weekend, amnesic, stats only"
// ", amnesic" is kept as it has always been said, and the two kinds are told apart by the words
// that follow it. Each preset's value is the session's (store/sessionAmnesic), and one subscription
// there answers for EVERY preset at once, including the ones you are not on.
// ⚠ IT IS SPOKEN AS ONE WHOLE PHRASE — "Weekend, amnesic", name included, in an `sr-only` element,
// with the visible name hidden from a screen reader beside it — rather than a ", amnesic" tail for
// the browser to join onto the name. A name assembled from several elements is joined by rules that
// differ by engine and by each piece's layout: Chromium puts a space between a block-level piece
// and its neighbour (the name is a flex item, the sr-only span is absolutely positioned), which
// read as "Weekend , amnesic"; and a join that trims each piece drops a leading space instead,
// which is "Weekendamnesic". One text node has nothing to join, so it reads the same everywhere.

// ★ THE FLOOR OF A PRESET NAME'S CELL — before round 20 this was the ONLY number the whole control was
// measured from (the trigger's exact width, and MAX_PRESET_NAME derived from it); since then the
// trigger's width is no longer this file's to state at all — it is whatever main.tsx's row does
// not spend on the logo, the mode selector, the gear and their gaps, and THAT arithmetic now lives
// at the budget block above the bar's markup in src/main.tsx, measured in a real layout engine the
// same way this constant always was.
//   WHAT'S LEFT HERE IS JUST THE FLOOR: 4.5em. It was 6em (the old fixed width) through round 20,
// but round 21 widened the mode selector to match its own dropdown and that +34.72px came
// straight out of THIS control's flex-1 share — the switcher's trigger is ~105px at 360×800 now,
// not ~140px. A 6em floor (~82px at text-sm) then exceeded the trigger's usable inner width once
// px-2.5 + pr-6 (the chevron lane) were taken out (~69px), so a near-floor name overflowed UNDER
// the ▲▼ on the tightest layout AND the live cap (lib/presetNameWidth, which measures this cell's
// rect) read the inflated floor and let too-wide names through. 4.5em (~61px at text-sm) sits
// inside the tightest usable width with margin, so the cell can never be forced past what is
// visible and the cap reads a true number. It is still a MINIMUM, not a fixed width — on a roomier
// phone the cell block-fills well past it and the cap allows a correspondingly longer name; the
// dropdown's larger text tier renders the same 4.5em roomier still, automatically.
export const PRESET_NAME_COL = '4.5em'
// The DOM hook lib/presetNameWidth reads to learn this control's LIVE rendered cell width — see
// the ⚠⚠ block above. Scoped to `[data-select-trigger]` (the trigger button CustomSelect marks
// with that attribute for `pressDrag`) so it can only ever match one of the seven cells STACKED IN
// THE TRIGGER, never a row in the portaled dropdown (which carries a DIFFERENT attribute,
// `data-select-group`, on an entirely separate portaled element) — an ambiguity that would matter
// if the switcher's own menu happened to be open at the same moment the rename field is measuring,
// which the ⚙ Presets modal and this control's dropdown can, in fact, both be open at once (the
// same exclusion that lets pressing this trigger with the ⚙ panel open open the menu instead of
// closing the panel — see the press-outside note near the top of this file). All seven stacked
// cells share the exact same rendered width regardless of which is the visible one (that sharing
// is the whole "stack every option in one grid cell" trick CustomSelect's trigger already relies
// on), so matching the FIRST one in document order is exactly as correct as matching the selected
// one, without needing to also filter for `aria-hidden="false"`.
export const PRESET_NAME_CELL_SELECTOR = '[data-select-trigger] [data-preset-name-cell]'

// owner's "learn it once"). Exported rather than copied so the two can never drift: a name that
// truncates here and overflows there, or an amnesic preset that one list forgets to announce, would
// be exactly the kind of disagreement this file's history keeps paying for.
// ⚠ `data-preset-name-cell` COMES ALONG TO "Open in" TOO, AND IS INERT THERE: PRESET_NAME_CELL_SELECTOR
// is scoped to a `[data-select-trigger]` ancestor, which only this switcher's trigger has (it is the
// one with pressDrag), so lib/presetNameWidth can never measure the ⚙ panel's copy by mistake.

    // what stops the two from drifting. No `width` any more, only `minWidth`: the cell's actual
    // width now comes from filling whatever its ancestor chain hands it (see the trigger's

          conditions at the moment typed", never "fits forever" — the live site and staging share
          one origin with proven build-skew bugs already, the switcher's own width can change
          after typing (a rotation, a text-size accessibility setting, a viewport resize), and a
          canvas measurement is not bit-for-bit identical to this element's own DOM layout. This
          is the safety net that makes all three survivable instead of an overflowing name. */}
