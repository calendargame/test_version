// components/useYearRangeMirrors.ts — the ⚙ panel's two Year Range TEXT BOXES, as state.
//
// The boxes are not the setting. minY/maxY in the settings store are the setting; these are
// transient string mirrors that deliberately DISAGREE with the store between a keystroke and its
// commit, so that a half-typed "19" is not read as the year 19. The two strings, the two commits
// and the two store→text sync effects are one unit, and this module is that unit.
//
// ★ WHY IT IS CALLED BY App AND NOT BY THE PANEL. Two reasons now, and they point the same way.
// FIRST, LIFETIME: the panel is conditionally rendered — it unmounts on close and remounts on open.
// State it owned would be re-initialised from the store on every open, and today a half-typed year
// SURVIVES closing and reopening the panel, which is pinned behaviour
// (tests/settingsPanel.yearRange.dom, "PINS TODAY: a half-typed year survives closing and reopening
// the panel"). Owning the pair up in App is what keeps that true.
// SECOND, AUDIENCE (round 15): the panel is no longer the only reader. App's settingsAtDefaults
// compares both strings, and the ⚙ gear draws the answer while the panel is CLOSED — the owner's
// call that a typed-but-uncommitted year counts as "changed" for all four offers. A hook the panel
// owned could not answer a question asked while the panel does not exist.
// ⚠ App therefore re-renders on every keystroke in a year box. It always did — these two useStates
// have been App's since before the extraction, and setMinInputVal has always re-rendered App —
// so reading the values in App's own render costs nothing extra. Nothing here memoises the change
// away, and nothing should try to: the whole point is that the gear reacts to the keystroke.
//
// ★ WHY THE TWO REFS ARE PARAMETERS RATHER THAN PART OF THE RETURN. They are the same shape as
// settingsPopoverRef: created by App, attached by the panel, read by App-side code — here the two
// focus guards below, which are the ONLY readers and which live in this file, so the ref is never
// split from its reader. Returning them instead is what the first draft did, and the React
// Compiler's react-hooks/refs rule rejected it at the CALL site: once a ref flows out of a hook
// inside an object, the compiler treats that whole object as a ref, so `yearRange.min.value` reads
// as a ref access during render. That is the rule working correctly — a hook handing back a
// structure it cannot prove is render-safe — so the fix is the shape, not a suppression.
//
// ★ DO NOT HAND-MEMOISE THE RETURN. A plain object literal built fresh on every call looks like it
// would churn identity and defeat the compiled panel's memo cache — it does not. This hook IS
// compiled (verified in the shipped bundle, round 14: it opens `let o = _c(34)` and the tail reads
// `o[31] !== w || o[32] !== T ? (D = {min: w, max: T, resetTo: E}) : D = o[33]`, with commitMin /
// commitMax cached on their real inputs and resetTo pinned to a memo_cache_sentinel). The compiler
// already does exactly what a useCallback/useMemo pass would, and it does it without the deps
// arrays that would then need hand-maintenance. Adding them here would be duplicated, less
// accurate work — and it is what re-opened the refs-rule problem above the first time.

  // ★ SEEDED FROM THE STORE, and round 15 is the round that had to do it. These two used to
  // initialise to the FACTORY literals '1' / '10000' rather than to the persisted minY/maxY, so a
  // user whose saved range is, say, 1900–2100 had mirrors reading "1"/"10000" for exactly one
  // commit — until the store→text effects below ran on mount. That was pre-existing defect D8, and
  // round 14 left it alone on a MOUNT argument: nothing outside the panel read these strings, and
  // the panel cannot be on screen that early, so the wrong value was never rendered.
  //
  // The note that stood here spelled out the exact condition that would retire the argument —
  // "it breaks the moment anything renders these strings outside the panel … seed these from
  // minY/maxY here first, a lazy initialiser is all it takes" — and round 15's first change is
  // precisely that: App's settingsAtDefaults now compares both strings, and the ⚙ gear renders the
  // result while the panel is CLOSED. On a boot with a saved range the old literals would have
  // disagreed with the store for one render and lit the gear's violet bar on a launch state that is
  // at its defaults. So the seed is no longer a tidiness fix; it is what makes change 1 correct.
  //
  // Lazy on purpose: the initialiser is read once, so this costs one String() at mount rather than
  // one per render, and it CANNOT drift from the effects below — both spell String(minY).

  // keeps its identity for the life of the component, so this still re-runs on a minY change only.
