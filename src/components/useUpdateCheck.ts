// useUpdateCheck — the ⚙ Settings "Check for updates" button's whole INTERACTION, in one place.
//
// The feature has always been three parts, and until round 15 only two of them had a home:
//   • THE DETECTOR — "is a different build deployed?" — src/lib/updateCheck.ts, pure, and the long
//     account of why it is a build-identity file (and not cache:'reload', not DEPLOY_TS, not
//     registration.update()) lives there.
//   • THE INTERACTION — this file. One button whose LABEL IS ITS STATE, the 3s result window, the
//     refusal of a second in-flight check, and the abort-on-close below.
//   • THE APPLIER — App's applyUpdate, passed in. It stays in main.tsx deliberately: it raises the
//     Updating overlay (setUpdating), claims the overlay through to a navigation
//     (updateReloadPendingRef, shared with the Q2 build-change flash), and drives the reload gate /
//     forceReloadLatest — all App-and-module-scope machinery this hook has no business owning. From
//     here it is simply "there is something to get; take it from here", and it is TERMINAL: every
//     route out of it navigates, so nothing below runs afterwards and `updateCheck` is deliberately
//     left reading 'checking' underneath the full-screen overlay.
//
// STATE MACHINE: idle → checking → (current | offline) → idle after UPDATE_RESULT_MS, or → the
// applier when there is something to get. A press during a RESULT starts another check (the result
// is information, not a mode you have to dismiss); a press during 'checking' cannot happen — the
// button is disabled — and is refused anyway so a synthetic click cannot start a second in-flight
// check.
//
// ★ WHERE THIS HOOK MAY BE CALLED FROM: APP, AND NOTHING THAT UNMOUNTS WHEN ⚙ SETTINGS CLOSES.
// The abort-on-close below is a useSettingsCloseEffect, and that hook seeds its wasOpenRef from the
// first value it ever sees (useSettingsCloseEffect.ts:37) — a caller mounted while the panel is
// open and unmounted on close never produces the true→false transition, so its body NEVER RUNS.
// Nothing throws, and the suite would not catch it either: the unmount teardown at the bottom of
// this file also aborts the controller, and "reopening shows the resting label" would be satisfied
// by the state being destroyed rather than by the reset. So moving this call into a conditionally
// rendered settings panel would silently delete the abort while every existing case stayed green.
// It is a code-review gate, and this paragraph is it. App passes the panel the two values below.

  // costs the button a new onClick identity per render — never a stale applier.
