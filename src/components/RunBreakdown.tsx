// components/RunBreakdown — an ended run or round, solve by solve.
//
// Opened by TAPPING ANYWHERE ON THE STAT STRIP once a MoX run has ENDED — completed or failed — or a
// Blitz round has ended (StatPanel's onActivate). That gesture is free: on an ended run every stat
// box is already inert — MoX drops its timing toggle on `isLocked` and Blitz on `timerDone`, both
// because an ended strip is a result readout rather than a control — so the strip had a tap going
// spare and no competing meaning. It is also the right place for it: the thing you tap to see the
// solves is the thing showing you the number they add up to.
//
// ★ THE ROW, left to right (round 22):   12.  R  2024-1-4      fastest   2.00s
//   • the card's NUMBER — fixed width, so the letters line up behind it;
//   • the WEEKDAY LETTER (lib/format's DAY_LETTER — U M T W R F S) that date fell on, under the
//     card's own calendar snapshot (engine/runBreakdown computes it). Fixed width too, so the dates
//     line up behind it. A screen reader hears the full day name instead (see the row);
//   • the DATE, in the card's own `_fmt`, taking whatever width is left;
//   • the WORDS — fastest/slowest, and missed/shown/overridden — each LEFT of the time it labels;
//   • the TIME, last, right-aligned in a minimum-width column, so every row's time ends on one edge.
//
// ★ IT LIVES AND DIES WITH THE SCREEN. No persistence, no new saved data, no migration (the owner's
// call): it is built fresh from the engine state every time it opens, and it is gone the moment
// Reset clears the run. So there is no second copy of the run anywhere and nothing that can go stale
// — which is also why it can afford to be a live proof of the mean rather than a report about it.
// The maths lives in engine/runBreakdown; this file only formats it.
//
// It is a popup like the ⚙ panel's own, drawn in the same shared shell (components/Popup, which
// owns the whole popup contract — see components/modalContract). The card, shadow, and the scroll
// region's fades are the changelog popup's, literally: same tokens, same recipe.
//
// ⚠ THE MODE PAGE ITSELF MUST NEVER SCROLL (the owner's standing constraint), which is why this is
// a modal with its OWN internal scroller and not a section that grows the screen. A run can be a
// thousand solves long; the card's max-height caps it and the list scrolls inside.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// The words for a card that did not earn its point. `shown` is deliberately vague and the vagueness
// is the accurate part: Reveal, Show Codes and a timeout leave byte-identical records, so the panel
// says the one thing all three have in common instead of guessing which it was. See the ⚠ note in
// engine/runBreakdown for what it would take to tell them apart, and why that was not bought here.

            ★ WHICH FORMATTER EACH FIGURE TAKES IS THE WCA SPLIT (lib/modeFormat, regulation 9f1),
            APPLIED PER FIGURE RATHER THAN PER SECTION — which is what this block got wrong until
            round 22's fixer: it sent all of them through the ROUNDING formatter on the reasoning
            that "the summary is aggregates", and Fastest and Slowest are not aggregates. They are
            SINGLE SOLVES — the very rows below, which truncate — so a 0.395s solve printed
            "Fastest 0.40s" above its own row reading "fastest 0.39s", the panel contradicting itself
            about one number in two places. Both now truncate, exactly as their rows do.
            Mean, Median and Spread keep fmtTime: the first two are averages, and Spread is a
            DIFFERENCE of two times rather than a time anybody solved.
            ⚠ SPREAD IS A DIFFERENCE OF TWO ROUNDED-LOOKING NUMBERS AND IS COMPUTED FROM THE RAW
            ONES, so it can print a hundredth away from (slowest − fastest) as displayed. That is
            the correct trade: rounding the inputs first to make the subtraction "look right" would
            print a spread the run does not have. It reads null — and is omitted — unless there are
            at least two DISTINCT times to span, because a spread of 0.00s across identical solves
            is a fact about nothing. */}

                  can produce (round 22's fixer). It was `w-8` — 2rem, room for "1000." — which on a
                  two-solve run left a visible gap between "1." and the weekday letter for digits
                  that were never coming. `ch` is the width of a "0" and tabular-nums makes every
                  digit exactly that, so digits + 1 covers the number and its period with a hair to
                  spare (a "." is narrower than a digit). The row count IS the widest number, because
                  `n` is the 1-based position in the run (engine/runBreakdown), and it is measured
                  once for the whole list — so the column is still one width and everything behind

                  "trimmed" in an app that does not trim: it points at the two solves a trimmed

                  where it answers "why is there no time here?". Leaving it trailing would also have

                  and that space is a line-break opportunity that would split one number across two
                  lines in this narrow column. A dash here means the card contributed no time — a
