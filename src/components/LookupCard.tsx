// THE LIST IS THE PART OF THE PAGE THAT GIVES: it takes the room the heading above it does not need,
// and scrolls past that (measured flex layout, never a pixel max-height — tests/heightGuard).
//
// ★ IT IS WINDOWED (components/scrollRegion's useWindowedRows). Only the rows in and near view are
// drawn; two blank spacers stand in for the rest, so the list is exactly as tall as if every row
// were there and a history of thousands scrolls like one of ten. Everything a row needs is derived
// from its entry, so a row scrolled away and drawn again is the same row.
//   • SELECTION is the caller's (an id), not the DOM's — it is true of a row whether or not that
//     row is drawn, which is what lets a reload come back to a selected row far down the list.
//   • THE SELECTED ROW IS BROUGHT INTO VIEW when the selection changes (arrowing through the list,
//     a new lookup landing at the top) and centred when the list first appears with one selected.
//   • aria-setsize / aria-posinset tell a screen reader the row's place in the WHOLE list, which it
//     could otherwise only count from the rows that happen to be drawn.
//   • The two edge fades are the shared recipe's (useScrollEdgeState) and read the full height.
// `entries` stands in as the edge hook's active key, so the listener re-attaches whenever the list
// changes; its extent observer covers the list being resized under the user — a screen-size change,
// or Show Codes opening in the card above and taking the list's room.
// There are NO boundary surfaces: the list is not framed by lines or shadows, as on every other
// page — the fades already say "there is more this way".

              (geometry unchanged: .panel's own 1px border became the explicit border token).
              text-base is DELIBERATE and states the tier out loud: this is the page's primary
              text-entry field, a size up from the compact text-sm steppers elsewhere, and it kept
              that size only by inheriting the root font. Same rendered size as before (1rem /
              line-height 1.5 is exactly what it inherited) — now it can't drift by accident.
              appearance-none (round 8) is the same kind of statement for behaviour: the box
              declares its own border, background and radius, so appearance:auto would be a false
              declaration that also leaves iOS's native inner shadow and focus treatment live. */}

              is now on the same rule as every other typing surface in the app: Enter keeps the edit
              and lets go, Escape throws it away and lets go. Nothing in src/ or in How to Play
              names an exception any more, because there is no longer one.
              ⚠ THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY ENTER KEEPS FOCUS. IT NEVER DID — read runLookup: every
              exit path calls lookupInputRef.current?.blur() on success and .focus() on a refusal,
              so Enter has always meant "commit and let go" here, exactly as it does everywhere
              else, and the box only holds on when it has an error to show you. The claim was
              written while documenting this field as the app's Escape exception, and it was wrong
              on the day it was written; the owner caught it. Enter's behaviour is UNCHANGED by
              round 17 — only the description of it is.
              ⚠ ESCAPE REVERTS TO THE BASELINE, NOT TO EMPTY — see lookupAtFocusRef above for what
              sets that baseline and why it has to be captured rather than derived.
              ⚠ NO flushSync, AND THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THE ⚙ YEAR-BOX PRECEDENT DOES NOT CARRY.
              The year boxes need it because they commit ON BLUR: their revert and their blur landed
              in one React batch, so the commit still read the pre-revert text and re-committed the
              value Escape was discarding. This input has NO onBlur at all — blurring it commits
              nothing — so there is no commit to lose the race to, and forcing a synchronous render
              here would be cargo cult.
              ⚠ NOTHING ELSE ANSWERS THIS PRESS. Escape also closes the top open layer
              (components/overlayStack), but that rule stands aside whenever a text box has the
              keyboard — and opening any layer takes the keyboard away from this box first, so the
              two can never be waiting on the same press. */}

            sentence that happens to wrap: the formatted date, then the reading(s) — one for a
            post-reform date, one per calendar for an ambiguous one. The old two-line reserve held a
            sentence whose line count depended on the font, the width, the month name and the
            weekday length, so it survived by tuning; rows make the height a property of the
            structure instead. Measured at 375px, where the slot is 310px wide: the longest line
            that can land here is 'Gregorian: Does Not Exist' at 156.7px, so no reading line can
            wrap on any phone this app supports, and the gap message below is the same two lines it
            has always been. min-h-15 (3.75rem) is three text-sm line boxes and, being a scale
            utility, tracks the fluid root font instead of freezing a pixel height.

            belong together — top-aligned, an ordinary two-line answer left its spare third row as a
            blank line between the weekday and the button that explains it. The weekday (the last
            row, the thing that was asked for) lands in the same place every time, and the spare
            space reads as the break between the input above and the answer below. Never CENTRED:
