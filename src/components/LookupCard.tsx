          {/* The date input wears the site-wide interactive-border rule (Q7 round-7): inputs are
              controls you act on, so it carries border surface-tray — the sbtn-bd tier its
              Lookup/Clear button neighbors share — never the container .panel it once borrowed
              (geometry unchanged: .panel's own 1px border became the explicit border token).
              text-base is DELIBERATE and states the tier out loud: this is the page's primary
              text-entry field, a size up from the compact text-sm steppers elsewhere, and it kept
              that size only by inheriting the root font. Same rendered size as before (1rem /
              line-height 1.5 is exactly what it inherited) — now it can't drift by accident.
              appearance-none (Q4 round-8) is the same kind of statement for behaviour: the box
              declares its own border, background and radius, so appearance:auto would be a false
              declaration that also leaves iOS's native inner shadow and focus treatment live. */}
          {/* ★ THE ESCAPE CONTRACT, AND THE GAP IT CLOSED (round 17 — the owner's call). This box
              is now on the same rule as every other typing surface in the app: Enter keeps the edit
              and lets go, Escape throws it away and lets go. Nothing in src/ or in How to Play
              names an exception any more, because there is no longer one.
              ⚠ THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY ENTER KEEPS FOCUS. IT NEVER DID — read runLookup: every
              exit path calls lookupInputRef.current?.blur() on success and .focus() on a refusal,
              so Enter has always meant "commit and let go" here, exactly as it does everywhere
              else, and the box only holds on when it has an error to show you. The claim was
              written while documenting this field as the app's Escape exception, and it was wrong
              on the day it was written; the owner caught it. Enter's behaviour is UNCHANGED by
              round 17 — only the description of it is.
              ⚠ ESCAPE REVERTS TO THE BASELINE, NOT TO EMPTY — see lookupAtFocusRef above for what
              sets that baseline and why it has to be captured rather than derived.
              ⚠ NO flushSync, AND THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THE ⚙ YEAR-BOX PRECEDENT DOES NOT CARRY.
              The year boxes need it because they commit ON BLUR: their revert and their blur landed
              in one React batch, so the commit still read the pre-revert text and re-committed the
              value Escape was discarding. This input has NO onBlur at all — blurring it commits
              nothing — so there is no commit to lose the race to, and forcing a synchronous render
              here would be cargo cult.
              ⚠ IT STOPS PROPAGATION, and that half of the precedent DOES carry, for the reason
              round 14 wrote down at the year boxes and round 15 repeated at the AoX run length.
              App's Escape listener (main.tsx) is a document keydown in the BUBBLE phase that asks
              "does a text input have focus?" to decide the press is not its own; blur() below has
              already run by then, so without the stop it would find nothing focused and close the ⚙
              panel on a press meant for this box. The reachable order is the one aox.dom pins: the
              keyboard is ALREADY here when the panel opens, because tapping the gear does not move
              focus on iOS or Safari. Nothing else is lost by stopping it — VERIFIED rather than
              assumed: App's other keydown listener (the letter/mode map, on window) returns early
              for any INPUT and has no Escape branch at all; this card's own document listener bails
              the same way; CustomSelect's Escape is a React handler on its own trigger, which Tab
              moves focus to, so it can never be waiting on a press from in here; and the four
              settings-modal handlers are CAPTURE phase, so they have already run and cannot be
              stopped by anything here anyway (the two that can coexist with a focused text field
              carve one out themselves). */}

            the formatted date, rows 2–3 the reading(s) — one for a post-reform date (the third row
            stays empty), one per calendar for an ambiguous one. The old two-line reserve held a
            sentence whose line count depended on the font, the width, the month name and the
            weekday length, so it survived by tuning; rows make the height a property of the
            structure instead. Measured at 375px, where the slot is 310px wide: the longest line
            that can land here is 'Gregorian: Does Not Exist' at 156.7px, so no reading line can
            wrap on any phone this app supports, and the gap message below is the same two lines it
            has always been. min-h-15 (3.75rem) is three text-sm line boxes and, being a scale

            elev-shadow-down + the divider line together signal "fixed header above content
            scrolling below" — same pattern as the popover sticky footer's elev-shadow-up. The

            this element, so there is no toggle and no transition (round 10 item B). The
            lookup-history-header class survives as the stable name for this boundary surface —
            it is what the tests select — and no longer as a CSS transition hook.
            THE COUNT is INSIDE the History span, not a third flex child: the row is
            justify-between, so a third child would redistribute the whole header. As inline text
            at the row's own 11px tier it shares the line box the header already had, and
            whitespace-nowrap is what keeps that true at every width — a wrap is the one way this
            could grow the header, and a header that changes height under a shadow it casts onto
            the list below is exactly the reflow worth designing out (the same by-construction rule
            the history rows below follow). It appears from the SECOND entry on (a "(1)" beside
            a list you can see has one row is noise) and stops at the cap, where it simply reads
            (100). Dimmer than the label it follows — --tx-300-60 is the footnote tier, a step down
            from the header's own --tx-200-70 in every theme — so it reads as a detail about the
            heading rather than part of it. */}
