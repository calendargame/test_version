// StatPanel — the horizontal stats strip (Score / Accuracy / Streak / Last /
// Mean / Median) shown under the header in the timed/scored modes.
//
// A presentational shell: it renders whatever `stats` array it's given (each item
// {label, value, fn?, off?}) as equal-width cells separated by thin dividers.
// A cell with `fn` renders as a button. (The one thing it reads for itself is the Amnesic value —
// the fourth signal below.)
//
// ★ THE FOUR SIGNALS — one meaning each, and NO STRIKETHROUGH ANYWHERE (three since round 16; the
// dashed outline is the fourth):
//   • an em dash (—)  = there is no data YET, but there could be. It is produced by the VALUE
//                       ITSELF (fmtTime/truncTime/fmtAccuracyPct return '—' with nothing recorded),
//                       and by `dimmed` below, which is the same statement at strip scale.
//   • BLANK           = this group is HIDDEN. Comes from `off` and from nothing else.
//                       ⚠ "HIDDEN", NOT "still recording", AND NOT "you turned it off" — both of
//                       those are true of most callers and false of some, and this panel cannot tell
//                       which caller it has. Recording continues for the scoring trio in every mode,
//                       and for the timing trio in Blitz/AoX (visual-only). It does NOT continue
//                       for the timing trio in Classic/Deduction/Flash: there `off` rides the same
//                       flag as useGameEngine's `tracking`, so hiding actually STOPS the clock and
//                       re-enabling after answering costs a full reset (modes/modeHooks
//                       toggleTimingOff). And `off` is not always the user's own doing: Classic and
//                       Deduction SHIP with timing hidden (store/modePrefs), so the most-seen blank
//                       in the app is a launch default nobody chose.
//   • DIM             = nothing is being recorded at all (Save Stats off). Comes from `dimmed`, and
//                       applies to the WHOLE STRIP — never to one cell, because "this cell is not
//                       recording" is not a state the app has.
//   • A DASHED OUTLINE = these numbers are being recorded, but ONLY FOR THIS SESSION: the preset is
//                       on Amnesic: Stats Only or Full, and the strip is gone when the app is closed
//                       (index.css's .session-only argues the look). The whole strip, in every
//                       mode — under either value nothing in it is kept. The strip reads the value
//                       itself (store/amnesic), not a prop, so no mode screen can show a session's
//                       numbers unmarked by forgetting to pass one.
//                       ⚠ THE DIM WINS when both apply. With Save Stats off the strip holds no
//                       numbers at all — six dashes — so there is nothing on it to call
//                       temporary, and "nothing is being recorded" is the whole truth. One cue,
//                       never two stacked. (The Best readouts under it keep theirs: they still
//                       show real records — components/BestReadout.)
// The full table this builds to:
//   group on, no data ....... the values, which read '—'      plain
//   group on, has data ...... the values                      plain
//   group OFF ............... value cells BLANK, labels stay  plain
//   Save Stats off .......... '—' in every value cell         whole strip dimmed
//   group off + Save off .... value cells BLANK               whole strip dimmed
//   …any row with Save Stats ON, on Amnesic: Stats Only or Full ......... + the dashed outline
// Blank beats dash: your own choice is the more specific statement, so it is the one shown.
//
// It replaced a scheme where ONE `off` flag — `scoringOff || !saveStats` in modeHooks — drove BOTH
// a label strikethrough and an em dash. Two different facts arrived as one bit, so Save Stats off
// struck every box and your per-group choices became invisible underneath it (they were never lost;
// scoringOff/timingOff persisted and came back). And a shown-but-empty stat already read as a dash,
// so a dash could mean either "hidden" or "nothing yet" and a tap's effect was unpredictable. The
// two facts are now two flags — `off` (yours, per group) and `dimmed` (the app's, whole strip).
//
// ⚠ THE VALUE CELL IS A FIXED-HEIGHT BOX AND THE VALUE IS CENTRED IN IT — `h-[1lh]` on the wrapper
// around each value span. It answers two things at once, and it replaced a NBSP the value span
// rendered when blank (which answered only the first, and only for a blank cell):
//   1. a BLANK cell still reserves its height. An empty inline box has no line box and therefore no
//      height, so a cell that rendered literally nothing would collapse and the whole strip would
//      jump the instant you toggled a group off.
//   2. a SHRUNKEN cell keeps the same height, which the strut never covered. The auto-fit below
//      sets a smaller font-size on the value span; a smaller span has a shorter line box, and in
//      this top-packed column that put its glyphs HIGHER than its un-shrunk neighbours' — the
//      owner's photo of "940/1001" sitting smaller AND higher than the "93.9%" beside it. It is the
//      same class as the ⚙ footer-button catch (SettingsPanel's fitFooterBtns, 2026-07-13): a
//      fitted size and an un-fitted strut in the same box do not share a line. Here the fix cannot
//      be that one's ("size the container so the strut shrinks WITH the text") — these six boxes fit
//      INDEPENDENTLY, so a shrinking strut would make each cell a different height. Instead the box
//      stops depending on its content: one base-size line box tall always, value centred inside it.
//      Sizes still differ between boxes — that is the auto-fit doing its job, and forcing every box
//      down to the longest value's size would be a worse defect — but they now sit on one line.
// `1lh` is the wrapper's OWN line box (its `text-sm leading-tight`), so this is self-maintaining in
// exactly the way the NBSP was: change the base type and the height follows, with no number here to
// drift out of sync. It is also not a fixed pixel height — rem-based, so it rides index.css's fluid
// root font like everything else (tests/heightGuard.test.js). And the unit costs no browser support
// this app did not already spend: Tailwind v4's own preflight ships a `min-height: 1lh` into our
// built CSS, and v4's floor (Safari 16.4) is the same release that shipped `lh`.
//
// ⚠ AND IT CARRIES A SCREEN-READER-ONLY "Off" (a sibling `sr-only` span, so the auto-fit target
// below stays a single plain text node). Blank is a perfectly good visual signal and no signal at
// all to someone who cannot see it; without this word the cleanest state would also be the silent
// one. The reserved height is silent either way — an empty box announces nothing.
//
// ⚠ THE DIM CARRIES A WORD TOO, FOR EXACTLY THE SAME REASON — one sr-only line at the top of the
// strip when `dimmed`. Round 16 promoted the dim to a first-class signal with a meaning of its own
// ("nothing is being recorded"), and a meaning that only exists as an opacity is no meaning at all
// to someone who cannot see it: without this line, Save Stats off and a strip that simply has no
// data yet both announce as six dashes. It sits on the strip and not on a cell because the fact is
// the strip's — the same reason `dimmed` is one flag rather than six. `sr-only` is absolutely
// positioned, so like the "Off" it costs no layout and moves no pixel.
// ⚠ THE DASHED OUTLINE CARRIES ONE AS WELL — "These stats are for this session only" — in the same
// place. And since the strip can be ONE BUTTON (onActivate), whose aria-label replaces its content
// as its name, the line is also the strip's DESCRIPTION (aria-describedby): a screen reader that
// lands on the button hears its name and then this.
//
// VALUE AUTO-FIT: each value box AUTO-FITS — a per-box measure-and-scale keeps any value, however
// long (a big Score "12345/67890", a long solve time), inside its own cell on every device, while short
// values stay at the normal size. The math is in fitScale; the wiring is the layout effect below. It
// replaced a tiered char-count shrink that only ran on fractional values and triggered on the longest
// SIDE (so "123/456" didn't shrink but the narrower "1000/2" did), and never shrank the time boxes.
//
// ★ NO MORE `armedSpan` (round 21). This panel used to grow one wide "Enable and Reset Stats?"
// button in place of the three time cells while a two-tap arm was live — with two 1px phantom
// spacers to keep the surrounding flex math pixel-identical. That arm is the shared ConfirmModal
// now (modes/modeHooks' useStatsHideToggles), so the strip is always just six cells and this file
// no longer has a per-caller special case. Blitz/AoX never used it; Classic/Flash/Deduction now
// render the popup themselves.
//
// Extracted from main.jsx in Stage C, Step 4b. ⚠ The label's className keeps a SPACE before `${s.off…}`
// (`whitespace-nowrap ${`). It's required: Tailwind v4's source scanner silently drops any utility glued
// directly to `${` when that class appears nowhere else, which made the stat labels wrap. Don't "tidy"
// the space away. (Calendar Game layout bug-fix, 2026-06-01.)
