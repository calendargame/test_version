// Settings / Full Reset pair uses the derived FOOTER_RESET_BTN_CLASS below.)
// border border-transparent completes the RENDERED height (round 8, the round-4 lesson):
// a solid fill carries no visible border, but every control it is measured against does — the
// grid neighbours Reveal / Override / ‹ › wear `border surface-button`, and the ⚙ footer's
// View/Clear Saved Defaults pair wears `border surface-toggle`. A border counts toward rendered
// height, so without it this button's own height sat 2px under its row's (masked so far only
// because every host stretches its items).
// ⚠ THE NEIGHBOUR NAMED HERE USED TO BE "the Save-Defaults Cancel beside Clear", and round 22 removed
// every Cancel button in the app — so the EXAMPLE moved to a surviving `surface-toggle` pair while
// the RULE did not move at all. It is still measured against real neighbours: the ⚙ footer's trio
// (Save Defaults / Reset Settings / Full Reset share one row), and the mode screens' reset buttons
// beside their bordered grid controls. The two places this class now stands ALONE in its row — a
// ConfirmModal's confirm and the preset manager's Delete, both `w-full` since round 22 — keep the border
// for the same reason every variant does: the token is one height tier, not a per-row measurement.
// ring-on-fill: on this fill the keyboard's focus ring is white, like the label, and drawn a little
// way in — the theme's own ring colour is the card's text colour, which in the two light themes is
// dark and sinks into the rose (index.css, "THE KEYBOARD FOCUS RING"; .btn-solid carries the same
// for the purple).

// HOW A BUTTON SAYS "YOU CANNOT PRESS THIS" (round 15) — appended by the ⚙ footer's three
// buttons (Save Defaults / Reset Settings / Full Reset) while the app is not offering them, and
// ALWAYS alongside aria-disabled on the same element. The pair is the whole convention: the class
// draws it, the attribute announces it, and the button's own handler guard is what actually makes
// it inert. Three independent statements of one fact, deliberately — see the note at the footer.
//
// ⚠ NO pointer-events-none, and its ABSENCE is the load-bearing part. These three carried
// `opacity-60 pointer-events-none` until round 15 and nothing else: CSS-only withholding, which
// leaves a control that is greyed, unhittable by a mouse, silent to a screen reader — and still a
// tab stop. A keyboard user reached it, was told nothing, pressed it and got nothing. Removing
// pointer-events-none is what lets the cursor below actually paint (a pointer-events:none element
// is never hit-tested, so any cursor declared on it is dead), and it is why the hover rule in
// index.css now excludes aria-disabled: without that, a dimmed Save Defaults would brighten under
// the pointer while telling it not-allowed.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS WHY lib/pointerGestures NOW FILTERS aria-disabled EXPLICITLY (gestureTarget). Becoming
// hit-testable made these three visible to the press-drag controller for the first time: a drag from
// the ⚙ gear into the panel drew the drag-select ring on a greyed-out footer button that then did
// nothing on release. The invariant "a ring means a release will act" used to ride on
// pointer-events-none too, so removing the block here means the gesture layer has to state it. If
// you ever put pointer-events-none back on these, that filter stays — it is the honest rule and no
// longer a workaround for this class.
//
// ⚠ NOT SHARED WITH MethodBreakdown's CODES_BTN_DISABLED_CLASS, which is the same three tokens
// PLUS pointer-events-none. It looks like a dedup and is not: that button keeps the pointer block,
// so the strings genuinely differ. Converging them means deciding whether Show Codes should also
// become hittable-but-inert, which is its own change with its own gate.

// ── THE ⚙ FOOTER'S METADATA ROW ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Round 7 once hoisted a single FOOTER_LINK_ROW_CLASS over this row AND the View/Clear
// saved-defaults row, on the argument that they were "the same kind of row". That stopped being
// true — the saved-defaults pair moved into the pinned button block — and round 21 finished
// the divergence: those two are now plain equal-width PILL BUTTONS (the RESET_BTN_CLASS family,
// see SettingsPanel), a simple `flex gap-2` row that needs no named token at all. So only this
// one is left here, and it is a named token because it still carries an argument.
//
// ⚠ THE ~4px RING-CLEARANCE RULE: every footer text link wears `rounded-md px-1 -mx-1` — the
// padding gives the press-drag ring 4px of breathing room around the glyphs, and the equal
// negative margin cancels it so the TEXT keeps its exact flow position. So a row's margin boxes
// ARE its text boxes, and a 12px gap between them leaves 12 − 4 − 4 = 4px between the rings the
// padding draws. gap-3 is that 12px.
//
// justify-between is what puts the stamp hard left and Changelog hard right, and because the three
// margin boxes are the three text boxes it also splits the slack into two EQUAL text-to-text gaps
// — which is precisely "Check for updates sits halfway between the facing edges of its neighbours"
// (owner's call). gap-3 becomes the MINIMUM those two gaps can reach, so the ring clearance above
// is a floor the free space only ever widens. items-center keeps the Last Updated caption
// vertically aligned with its two button links; flex-wrap is the narrow-viewport fallback — at
// normal widths the row stays one line, and on a line that DOES wrap justify-between spreads
// whatever landed on it, which is the honest consequence of anchoring the ends rather than a
// second rule.

// Boxed numeric-input shared className (split into base + surface in round 7) — the app's
// second shared input idiom beside SliderValueEditor: a bordered box with centered tabular
// digits at the text-xs control tier. Used by the AoX run-length field (mode screen + the
// Save Defaults popup, both appending " py-1 w-14 shrink-0") and the ⚙ Year Range pair
// (" py-1.5 w-16"). These boxes NEVER declare a height — the engine derives one from the inner
// line box — and an <input> derives it through different machinery than a <button> does, landing
// ~2px apart in WebKit even when every class, padding and border matches. So a box is only ever
// flush with button neighbors because its ROW STRETCHES it (the AoX run-length row, items-stretch),
// never because the token strings agree. Anywhere that rule is dropped the box sits visibly proud;
// three rounds of trying to prove the derived heights match instead all failed on device.
// The surface is the site-wide interactive-border rule applied — border weight
// signals role (thin-bd dividers, panel/card-bd containers, sbtn-bd interactive controls):
// inputs are controls you act on, so every one wears surface-tray (stgl-bg + sbtn-bd, the
// no-hover interactive surface the settings segment trays share), matching the buttons —
// never the container .panel these boxes once borrowed. (The top-bar chrome — mode
// selector, gear, stat panel — deliberately STAYS .panel: the container tier, owner call.)
// NUM_INPUT_BASE carries the geometry alone so the DefaultsCard's dirty variant
// (NUM_INPUT_DIRTY_CLASS, defined beside the card) swaps the whole surface, not a token.
// appearance-none (round 8) turns the NATIVE form-field treatment off: these boxes fully
// declare their own border, background and radius, so leaving appearance:auto in place is a
// false declaration that also keeps iOS's own inner shadow and focus treatment live on top
// of ours. (Every text input in the app now states this: here, the Lookup date field, and
// SliderValueEditor's edit box via .svalue-input. Range sliders are deliberately untouched —
// their native track/thumb IS the control that index.css styles.)

// ⚠ CSS NEEDS THIS NUMBER TOO, AND CANNOT READ IT. A Tailwind class name is not something CSS can

// of these gutters) and [data-hit-pad]'s --hit-half (half a gutter, the reach of an answer button's
// extended hit area — sub-group 1B). Both now read the one variable, so the only join left to
// police is this token against that variable, and tests/answerHitPad.test.js fails the build if
// they ever disagree. Change this and change --answer-gap with it.
