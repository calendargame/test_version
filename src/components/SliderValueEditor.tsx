// SliderValueEditor — the tap-to-type value readout beside every timer slider (Round-2).
//
// Display mode renders the readout the sliders always had (tabular-nums text-xs, right-aligned)
// as a button; tapping it swaps in a small text input seeded with the current value, auto-focused
// — and the app-wide entry rule (lib/textEntry) highlights that seed, so typing replaces it
// outright. The validation trio is the
// AoX-N field's, adapted to numbers-with-units (lib/sliderValue):
//   • onChange — permissive regex only (digits, plus one '.' OR ',' when inputMode is decimal:
//     iOS/Android decimal keypads in comma-locales only offer ',', so rejecting it would silently
//     turn a typed "2,5" into "25" — commitSliderText normalizes the comma before parsing);
//   • commit on blur/Enter — parse → convert to internal units → snap to the slider's grid →
//     clamp into range; empty/junk reverts to the current value;
//   • Escape — revert WITHOUT committing. The press is this box's alone: the app's rule that
//     Escape closes the top open layer (components/overlayStack) stands aside while a text box has
//     the keyboard, so the panel or popup this readout sits in stays open, and a second Escape,
//     with nothing being typed, closes it. This was the app's FIRST discard-on-Escape field; the
//     AoX popup field, the AoX screen's own run-length box and the Lookup date box
//     (components/LookupCard) followed it onto the same contract. Escape therefore means "throw this edit away" in every box you can type into, with no
//     exception left to name: these readouts, both ⚙ Year Range boxes, the Save Defaults popup's N
//     field, the AoX screen's run length, and the Lookup date box.
//   • …and ENTER OR ESCAPE GIVES THE KEYBOARD BACK TO THE READOUT. The box is gone the moment
//     either is pressed, and the keyboard used to be left on nothing: in a popup that sent it to
//     the dialog card (components/Popup's rule for focus that goes nowhere), so the next Tab
//     started again from the popup's first control and a keyboard user lost their place. The
//     readout is the same control in its other state, so that is where it goes. Only for those two
//     keys: a box left by a tap or by Tab has already sent the keyboard where the player wanted it.
//
// Width + zero shift (round 8): the cell is a `relative inline-block` whose ONLY in-flow child
// is an always-mounted invisible block strut holding `widest`, so the cell locks to the widest
// POSSIBLE readout measured in the device's OWN font — identical across sites and constant at
// runtime (Round-4's hand-measured arbitrary width was Segoe UI's 3.18em; iOS's SF Pro renders
// "2m 55s" wider, and the overflow wrapped at the space). NOTE — every RETIRED utility below is
// described rather than written out: Tailwind v4's scanner reads .tsx comments as plain text
// (verified by probe), so spelling a dead class here would resurrect its rule in the shipped CSS.
// Only classes something still wears are named. BOTH live controls are taken OUT of flow on top
// of that strut, so neither can ever contribute to the cell's size:
//   • the display button is `absolute inset-0` — its border box is the strut box exactly. Its
//     `accent` (dirty) variant (round 6) wears the btn-solid pill via px-1 -mx-1, the
//     footer-link ring idiom: the fill bleeds 4px past the digits while the padding cancels back
//     to a CONTENT box equal to the strut, so the digits themselves never move.
//     ring-outside (index.css, "THE KEYBOARD FOCUS RING"): this button is exactly as tall as its
//     digits, and without the pill exactly as wide, so the keyboard's ring — drawn just inside a
//     control's edge everywhere else — would be drawn through them. Here it goes round the outside.
//   • the edit input is `.svalue-input` (index.css, beside .surface-tray) — the same idiom on both
//     axes, inset outward by its own 1px border + 1×--spacing padding so its CONTENT box also
//     equals the strut. It therefore fits the full widest string exactly (the AoX Run Length site
//     types up to "1000"), and the digits hold still through the tap-to-type swap.
// Round-7 instead left the input IN flow and CANCELLED its extra geometry with a negative
// block margin; Chrome netted that to zero, the owner's iPhone did not, and the horizontal half
// was never handled at all. Nothing here relies on intrinsic input sizing any more, so the old
// w-full / min-w-0 / size={1} collapses are gone with it (those two utilities are safe to name —
// other elements still wear them).
//
// The user always types SECONDS — Flash converts ×1000 to ms via fromText; milliseconds are never
// exposed (the readout label is already seconds everywhere). The ONE non-seconds site is the
// defaults manager's AoX run-length row (round 6), which types a plain count: it passes
// `editLabel` to replace the default "(seconds)"-suffixed input name. `disabled` mirrors the
// slider's own condition (mid-round lock); pointer-events-none + the aria flag rather than the
// disabled attribute so the readout keeps its exact resting look (the plain span never dimmed).
// The input wears `surface-tray` (stgl-bg + sbtn-bd — the interactive-control surface every
// editable box shares, round 7; the display state stays borderless bare text) for its colours;
// .svalue-input owns the geometry.
