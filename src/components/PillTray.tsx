// PillTray — the ⚙ Settings panel's segmented picker: one "concentric housing" tray of
// mutually-exclusive pill segments. Extracted from the Date Format groups (Round-3, rebuilt
// FLUSH Round-4) when the Theme rows adopted the same idiom (round-8), so the recipe below
// lives in ONE place instead of being re-typed per group. Round-9 made it the treatment for
// EVERY picker in the panel — Input and the three chance rows joined — so the housing now
// MEANS something: it is what says "pick exactly one of these". THE PICKER RULE that decides
// which controls get a tray is stated once, at the Display section in main.tsx.
//
// THE CONCENTRIC HOUSING IDIOM (why these exact classes):
// The container draws the whole frame (border + surface-tray, NO padding, NO overflow-hidden)
// and each borderless segment carries a CONCENTRIC radius — calc(var(--radius-xl) - 1px), the
// housing's rounded-xl minus its 1px border — so a selected btn-solid segment's fill arc traces
// the housing's inner edge exactly. (Equal radii offset by the border diverge ~0.41px at 45°,
// leaving a hairline tray-colored crescent at every flush corner — visible at 3x device pixel
// ratio.) Pressing a segment reads exactly like pressing an On/Off switch — the panel's only
// other control — a clean flush accent fill with no visible seam, and uniform rounding on all
// four corners even where a corner isn't
// flush. Unselected segments are transparent — the tray surface shows through, visible on its
// own only in the 2px gap-0.5 seams between segments. Still RING-SAFE: with no overflow-hidden
// the inset press-drag ring follows each segment's own radius instead of being clipped square
// (the Round-2 defect that unfused the originals). Height sits at the popover one-height control
// tier: segment text-xs + py-1.5 (~27.7px) + the housing's 1px top/bottom borders ≈ 29.7px —
// identical to the On/Off switch buttons beside it, which are the same text-xs + py-1.5 inside
// their own 1px border. That is the whole tier; no other padding may sneak in.
//
// PURELY PRESENTATIONAL: the tray owns the segments' radio semantics (role="radio" +
// aria-checked) but NOT the group's. The caller wraps it in a PillGroup (components/PillGroup),
// which supplies role="radiogroup" + the accessible name + the keyboard contract + the lock —
// and the group is the CHOICE, not the tray: where two trays read and write one setting (the
// Written/Numeric date formats, and the two theme rows while Use System is off) ONE PillGroup
// spans both, because a group whose radios are all unchecked while the real selection sits in a
// sibling group tells assistive tech something false. Which is also why `ariaLabel` exists below:
// two trays inside one group can repeat a visible label ('MDY' appears in both date-format
// trays), and radios in a group must be tellable apart by name.
//
// THE TAB STOP is per GROUP, not per tray (round-9 Q2): the pill holding the group's value is
// tabbable and every other pill is not, so two trays sharing one setting still add up to ONE tab
// stop and the arrows walk straight from one into the other. PillGroup appoints that pill and
// drives that walk; the full contract is documented there. What the tray owns is the SEGMENT half
// of the same contract — an activated radio takes focus (see onClick), which is what puts the
// keyboard inside a group in the first place.
//
// WIDTH: flex-1 segments split the tray evenly. flex items are min-width:auto, so an over-long
// label pushes the tray WIDER rather than truncating — there is no truncation fallback, so a
// label that doesn't fit BREAKS the panel instead of degrading. The tightest tray shipped is a
// five-step chance row, where "Random" gets a fifth of the panel; every tray is nonetheless
// roomier per label than the gap-separated row it replaced, because a ~2px gap-0.5 seam stands
// in for a ~6px gap-1.5 plus the two 1px button borders it used to separate. Budget for new
// labels: "Random" at five segments, checked on the narrowest realistic phone (~375px CSS
// width, where the fluid root font bottoms out and the panel interior is ~297px).
//
// Generic in the option value so call sites pass their store's own union type (FormatId, a
// theme id) with no cast at either end.

// The bordered housing. No padding and no overflow-hidden — both would break the flush fill
// and the press-drag ring (see the idiom note above).
