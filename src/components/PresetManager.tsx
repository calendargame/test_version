// ============================================================
// PresetManager — the card behind the ⚙ menu's "Manage Presets" button: make a preset, rename one,
// move one up or down the list, delete one.
//
// ── WHY IT IS A ⚙ MODAL AND NOT PART OF THE SWITCHER ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ★ THE SWITCHER IS FOR CHOOSING, THIS IS FOR EDITING, AND MERGING THEM WAS REJECTED ON TWO COUNTS.
// The obvious alternative was a "Manage…" row at the foot of components/PresetSwitcher's dropdown.
//   • It would need a SENTINEL option value threaded through CustomSelect's onChange, which is
//     `switchPreset(Number(v))` today — one line whose whole virtue is that it cannot mean anything
//     but "open this preset". A row that looked like a preset and was not is the shape of bug that
//     ends with switchPreset called on an id nothing owns.
//   • The dropdown lives in the FIXED top bar and CustomSelect measures its panel ONCE per open
//     from the trigger's viewport rect (the caller contract at the top of that file). A panel that
//     could grow a rename field and a confirmation step is a panel that changes height while it is
//     open, which is exactly the thing that contract says it does not survive.
// The ⚙ panel is where every other thing you do TO your saved data already lives — Save Defaults,
// the defaults manager, Clear Saved Defaults, Reset Settings, Full Reset — and it already has a
// popup idiom with a shared contract. So this is one more user of that contract, not a new style:
// the same shell (components/Popup), the same card, the same tokens.
//
// ── ⚠⚠ THE CONFIRMATION IS A VIEW OF THIS CARD, NOT A POPUP ON TOP OF ONE ─────────────────────
//
// Deleting a preset that holds anything asks first (a preset that holds nothing skips the question
// — see the ★ further down), and the ask REPLACES this card's body rather than opening a second
// dialog over it. The question is about a row of this list, so it is answered where the list was:
// one card, one place to look, and stepping back out of the question lands on the list again with
// nothing to re-open. (It is a choice, not a limit. The app stacks popups properly —
// components/overlayStack — and the storage-full notice does open over this card.)
//
// ★★ AND IT IS A VIEW YOU CAN DISMISS BACK OUT OF — THE LADDER. There is no Cancel button (the
// owner's rule, app-wide: tapping outside or pressing Escape already says it), so every dismiss
// route has to mean "never mind" here too: while a delete is pending, a dismiss returns to the
// LIST, and a second dismiss closes the card. It is the ladder the rename field below has always
// had (the first Escape belongs to the name being typed, the second to the card), applied to the
// other view.
// ⚠ WHICH IS WHY `pendingDeleteId` IS A PROP AND NOT THIS COMPONENT'S OWN STATE. A ladder is a
// decision about a DISMISS, and the dismiss handlers belong to the caller (components/SettingsPanel
// gives the popup its onDismiss and registers the question as its own entry in the stack, so that
// Escape and Android Back have something to close that is not the whole card) — so the flag they
// branch on is held there, beside them, and handed down. Everything about DRAWING the two views is
// still this component's, focus included.
// ⚠ THE DIALOG'S ACCESSIBLE NAME THEREFORE CHANGES WITH THE VIEW, and both titles are FIXED
// STRINGS — "Presets" and "Delete this preset?". The preset's name is in the confirmation's BODY
// and deliberately not in its title: the Changelog popup paid for that lesson (see the ★ at its
// heading row in components/SettingsPanel), where an id placed one element too high made the
// dialog's name change on every deploy. A landmark that renames itself per row is the same defect.
//
// ── WHAT EACH CONTROL ACTUALLY DOES, and where the honesty is owed ───────────────────────────
//
// ★ NEW PRESET STARTS FROM FACTORY DEFAULTS, NOT FROM A COPY OF THE ONE YOU ARE ON (the owner's
// call). Nothing here implements that: store/presetControl's createPreset allocates an id whose
// keys hold nothing, and store/presets' mergeOverDefaults is what turns "no saved copy" into the
// factory values instead of a clone of whatever was in memory. This button is the call.
// ★ AND IT DOES NOT SWITCH TO WHAT IT MAKES, which is createPreset's documented contract rather
// than an omission here: creating and opening are separate acts, so making a preset cannot yank a
// player out of the round they are in. The new row appears at the foot of the list; the switcher in
// the top bar is how you go to it.
//
// ★★ RENAMING IS CAPPED AT THE INPUT, AND — SINCE ROUND 20 — BY WIDTH RATHER THAN BY COUNT.
// It used to be a character count, twice over (a `maxLength` for the browser's own enforcement,
// plus a `slice` in onChange for the paste-shaped write maxLength does not cover). That worked only
// because the switcher's display cell was ALSO a fixed count of characters; once the cell became
// flexible (components/PresetSwitcher), a character cap stopped answering the question that
// actually matters — "will this fit the switcher, RIGHT NOW, on THIS device" — so onChange now
// calls lib/presetNameWidth's capCandidateToSwitcherWidth on every keystroke, which measures the
// candidate against the switcher's LIVE rendered cell width (a real canvas measurement against a
// real DOM element in another part of the tree entirely — see that file for the mechanism and why
// it is not a React prop or a store) and trims to the longest prefix that fits, exactly the shape
// `maxLength` gives a paste. `nameWidthCapped` is what that trim sets, and it drives the small
// WIDTH-language note below the field ("That's as long as this name can display.") rather than a
// character count, because a character count is no longer the true reason.
// ⚠ `maxLength={MAX_PRESET_NAME}` STAYS ON THE ELEMENT, as a SEPARATE, coarser backstop — the
// store's own hard ceiling (store/presets argues why it is now a generous, device-independent
// number rather than a pixel-tuned one), reached only if the width cap somehow fails to fire (a
// browser with canvas disabled, say). In ordinary use the width cap is reached first, well under
// it. Layering them is the same "no one cut alone covers every case" reasoning this field always
// used, just with a different pair of cuts.
//
// ★★ MOVING IS A DEDICATED DRAG HANDLE, AS OF ROUND 20 — REPLACING THE ↑/↓ PAIR THIS COMMENT
// USED TO ARGUE AGAINST A DRAG FOR. The owner's call, made explicit rather than re-litigated here:
// no arrow buttons, one control that is both a pointer/touch drag and a keyboard reorder action.
// The two prior pointer gestures that passed in Chromium and failed on the owner's iPhone (round
// 11's mode selector) were a DIFFERENT SHAPE of gesture in a different part of this app — press,
// drag across an open surface, release wherever — and neither reason they failed is a reason a
// dedicated handle has to fail the same way:
//   • THE GESTURE NEVER STARTS ANYWHERE BUT THE HANDLE. The mode selector's failure mode was a
//     press ambiguous between "open a menu" and "start scrolling/panning", decided differently by
//     iOS than by Chromium. This list is inside a scroll region (components/scrollRegion), and the
//     one thing that keeps a drag from fighting that scroller is that only ONE small element per
//     row — never the row, never the name field, never the list itself — ever attaches a drag
//     listener at all. Touching anywhere else is unconditionally an ordinary scroll or tap.
//   • touch-action:none IS DECLARED ON THAT ONE ELEMENT, and nowhere wider (below), which is the
//     platform's own opt-out of exactly the ambiguity that broke the mode selector — told to the
//     browser, not inferred from timing.
//   • THE MECHANISM IS NATIVE POINTER EVENTS WITH EXPLICIT CAPTURE (setPointerCapture on
//     pointerdown), rather than a bespoke touch/mouse pair. ⚠ THIS IS THE FIRST USE OF BROWSER
//     CAPTURE IN THIS APP — a claim that it shares "the same primitive" as lib/pointerGestures
//     stood here until it was checked against that file: pointerGestures latches its own gesture
//     with a plain module-scope `pointerId` variable and DOCUMENT-level listeners, never the
//     browser's own capture API. What the two genuinely share is the GUARD, not the mechanism —
//     "only the primary contact of a left-button mouse, or any primary touch/pen, may start a
//     gesture" is copied verbatim from CustomSelect's pressDrag (see beginDrag below) — and that
//     part IS accurate. Capture was chosen here anyway, over pointerGestures' pattern, because
//     THIS gesture is scoped to one small element rather than the whole document — capture keeps
//     onPointerMove/Up attached to the handle itself with no listener to install or tear down at
//     the document level, which pointerGestures' document-wide reach genuinely needs and this
//     control does not.
// None of that is a promise the drag will read as smooth ON DEVICE — it cannot be, from here (see
// lib/presetReorder for what the mechanism actually does, and PROJECT.md's standing rule that a
// gesture is device-verified or it is not verified at all). It is the argument for why this design
// has a real chance where a plain "onPointerMove sets a translateY" implementation would not.
//
// ★ THE ARITHMETIC ITSELF IS lib/presetReorder's, kept OUT of this component on purpose — jsdom has
// no layout engine, so the "which slot is the pointer over" decision has to be provable against
// fabricated numbers, independent of any real render. This file only wires real pointer/keyboard
// events to it and to store/presetControl's movePreset, which is completely unchanged by this
// round: a drag commits, once, at the finger lift, as the same ±1 adjacent-swap calls the keyboard
// path (and the old buttons before it) already made one at a time. See movePreset's own comment for
// why that single primitive is enough for both.
//
// ★ DELETING IS PERMANENT AND THE CARD SAYS SO IN THOSE WORDS — WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING TO SAY IT
// ABOUT. The question is SKIPPED for a preset that is still bit-identical to a new one:
// every ⚙ setting at its factory value, no stats or bests, no saved defaults, no parked round.
// Nothing is permanent about deleting a preset that holds nothing, so the confirmation would be a
// tap spent on a non-decision. The test is store/presetControl's isPresetFactory — deliberately
// written so that it can only ever be WRONG in the direction of asking — and it is read at the
// press, never rendered from (see pressDelete below for why the ✕ looks identical either way).
// For the preset you are ON it also takes the screens into account (`screensFresh`): a round or run
// in progress, or an ended one still showing, is something to lose even though no store holds it.
// For every preset that does hold something, everything below is unchanged. Two cases are real and
// both are handled out loud rather than hidden:
//   • THE ACTIVE PRESET. deletePreset opens the neighbour, which IS a switch — so the screens are
//     cleared by src/main.tsx's registry subscription, a round or run in progress included. The
//     confirmation says that in advance, because it is the one consequence a player would otherwise
//     meet as a surprise.
//   • THE LAST REMAINING PRESET. deletePreset REFUSES it (the app cannot render "no presets", and
//     "delete everything" is what Full Reset is for), so the control is withheld in the app's own
//     three-statement convention — drawn unavailable, announced unavailable, and inert in its own
//     handler — plus a line under the list saying why, because a dim on its own states a fact and
//     not a reason.
// ⚠ WHAT THE CARD DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MENTION is that deleting preset 1 vacates the un-namespaced
// storage keys forever, so a build that has never heard of presets would open factory-fresh
// afterwards. It is true (store/presetControl's deletePreset argues it in full) and it is not
// something a player can observe from inside this app, so putting it in a confirmation would be
// spending a reader's attention on a fact that cannot help them decide.
// ============================================================

// THE ROW'S TWO ICONS — DeleteIcon (the ✕) and ReorderHandleIcon (the grip) — both inline SVG drawn
// in currentColor, the house pattern (W5Logo, GuidePage's dot diagram): no icon font, no external
// asset, and always the colour of the text around them.
// ⚠ BOTH ARE aria-hidden, AND NEITHER NEEDS A NAME OF ITS OWN: the control that renders each one
// carries an aria-label, which REPLACES an element's content for a screen reader. (That is the

// ── THE ROW, LEFT TO RIGHT ON SCREEN: ✕ · name · ✓ · grip ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// ★ THE iPHONE REORDER-LIST CONVENTION, AND THE REASON IS A MIS-TAP, NOT LOOKS. The grip and the ✕
// used to sit side by side at the right edge. The grip is the control a thumb reaches for over and
// over; the ✕ is the destructive one, and a preset that holds nothing deletes on the spot with no
// question to catch a slip. A frequently-grabbed handle beside a destructive button is how a
// reorder becomes a delete. So they are at opposite ends — the ✕ at the LEFT edge, the grip at the
// RIGHT edge where the thumb already is — with the name between them and the current-preset mark
// after the name.
//
// ★★ THE ORDER IN THE MARKUP IS DIFFERENT, ON PURPOSE: name · ✓ · grip · ✕ — the ✕ LAST. The
// markup order is the order Tab walks and the order a screen reader reads, and the on-screen order
// would make "Delete <the first preset>" the first thing the keyboard lands on in this popup: one
// Tab and one Enter from opening it, a preset that holds nothing would be gone, unasked. So the
// row reads its name first, then the handle that moves it, and the destructive control comes last;
// each cell is PLACED in its on-screen column by class (ROW_COL below), which is what lets the two
// orders differ. The same slip is why nothing destructive ever takes the keyboard on open: the
// popup focuses its card, never a control.
//
// THE ✕ KEEPS ITS BUTTON CHROME (the owner's ask): a boxed control says "tap". `shrink-0` because
// the NAME is the thing that gives way when the card is narrow — a control that shrank to a sliver
// would be the wrong casualty. The surface is `surface-toggle`, the same no-fill interactive tier
// Manage Presets and the View/Clear Saved Defaults pair wear: pressing it does not always delete (a
// preset that holds anything asks first), and the rose fill is kept for the button that commits a
// deletion — the confirmation's own Delete.
// IT IS A CENTRING BOX: `self-stretch` makes it exactly as tall as the name box beside it (the row's
// track), and the flex centring puts the icon in the middle of that — both ways, in every font.
// ⚠ TOUCH SIZE IS A DEVICE-ONLY QUESTION. At the card's ~288px of content it lands near 28×30px, the
// ⚙ panel's existing control tier (its On/Off switches are px-3 py-1.5 text-xs) and not a new,
// smaller one — but jsdom lays nothing out, so only the owner's iPhone can say whether it is
// comfortable.

// bare ≡ says "drag", where a boxed one reads as one more thing to tap. What it keeps is everything

// (`self-stretch` takes the row's full height, px-3 gives it ~38px of width), a grab cursor for a
// mouse, and a FOCUS RING for the keyboard route (index.css's .kbd-ring): the grip
// is Tab-reachable and its ↑/↓ move a preset, and with no border or fill of its own there is nothing
// else that could show the keyboard is on it.
// The glyph is quieter than the text (--tx-200-80) because it is furniture until it is held.
// ★ THE RING IS FOR THE KEYBOARD, AND A GRAB IS NOT THE KEYBOARD. The ring draws on :focus-visible,
// which is the browser's own guess at "the keyboard put focus here" — and the guess is wrong for a
// grab: a press on the grip focuses it from script (beginDrag says why it has to), and a browser
// treats a scripted focus as keyboard focus whenever the keyboard was the last thing used. So after
// one Tab or arrow inside the card, grabbing a row with a finger or a mouse drew the ring on it.
// The card therefore says which it was: the one grip a pointer press focused carries
// `data-pointer-focus` until it loses focus or takes a key (pointerGripId, in the component), and
// index.css draws no ring on a grip so marked — neither its own nor the browser's default one.

//
// ★ WHAT A DRAGGED ROW LOOKS LIKE: ITS PARTS, MOVING TOGETHER — NOT A SLAB. All of it travels (✕,
// name, ✓, grip: a ✕ left behind beside a gap would read as belonging to nothing), but only the two
// pieces that are boxes at rest are drawn lifted: the ✕ button and the name box each get the
// "picked up" shadow. The ✓ and the grip have no box at rest and are given none in the hand — they
// ride along as the bare marks they are. What this replaced drew ONE rounded surface behind the
// whole row, the empty stretch between the name and the grip included; the owner found a lifted
// shape with nothing in most of it strange, and it is gone.
//
// Three classes, all index.css's, worn only by the row being dragged:
//   • HELD_PIECE_CLASS — on the ✕ button and the name box. Their resting fill is a see-through
//     tint over the card; in the hand the same tint is laid over the card's own solid colour, so
//     the piece looks exactly as it did and the row passing underneath cannot show through it.
//   • HELD_SHADOW_CLASS — the lift itself, on two empty boxes drawn in the ✕'s and the name's own
//     grid cells (heldShadows, in the row). Separate boxes, behind everything in the row, because a
//     shadow on the pieces themselves falls on the piece beside it: the two are 4px apart and the
//     shadow spreads 12, so whichever was painted second would smudge the other's edge.
//   • HELD_INK_CLASS — on the ✓ and the grip's bars: a patch
//     of the card's colour exactly behind the mark, invisible against the card. It is what stops a
//     row sliding past underneath from drawing its own grip THROUGH this one for the tenth of a
//     second the two cross. It is not a surface — it has no edge, no shadow and no size beyond the
//     mark — and it never covers anything at rest: lib/presetReorder's targetIndexForCenter keeps
//     the dragged row at least half a row from every other, which is further than the patch

// and what a dismiss means, exactly as it does for the other popups. The dismiss routes LADDER
// through this value (the header comment argues why it therefore lives with them and not here), so
// the card both reads it to pick its view and writes it when the ✕ poses the question or the Delete

  // than a neighbouring row's ✕, for two reasons: it is exactly where the confirm route leaves the
  // keyboard (the effect above focuses the list's card when the question closes), so the skip stays
  // "the same act with the question removed" for a keyboard or screen-reader user too; and a ✕ that
  // inherited focus would turn a held Enter — which repeats a button's click — into a run of deletes
  // the player never aimed at. Focusing it now, before the delete commits, is safe: the list view's

  // handler below reads this one value directly rather than juggling several booleans.

  // top of the scrollable content, not of the screen — except the two pointer readings, which are
  // viewport y because that is what a pointer event reports. It used to be viewport y throughout,
  // which was only correct while the list could not scroll mid-drag. Unlimited presets make a
  // list taller than its region the ordinary case, and the drag now scrolls it (the edge auto-scroll
  // below), so "where is the row" has to be measured against the content, which is what the row's
  // own transform is relative to. `startScrollTop` is what turns a pointer delta into a content
  // delta: every pixel the list has scrolled since the grab is a pixel the pointer has effectively
  // travelled through the list.
  //
  // `slotMidpoints[i]` is the vertical center the row THAT STARTED AT INDEX i occupies in the
  // content — captured ONCE, from a getBoundingClientRect() on every row, and never re-measured

  // is correct for the whole gesture only because nothing moves in the DOM's actual flow while a
  // drag is in flight (that file's own header comment argues why the model commits once, at the

                keyboard move — this app uses no aria-live (SettingsPanel's Check-for-updates button
