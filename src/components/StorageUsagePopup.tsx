// StorageUsagePopup — what is using the device's room for this app, and how to get some back.
//
// One popup, two ways in: the "Storage used: N%" line in ⚙ opens it, and it opens BY ITSELF once
// when the reading first passes the warning line (store/storageUsage decides when, and remembers
// that it did). It is the EARLY warning; components/StorageFullNotice is the late one, for a save
// the device has already refused, and takes precedence — this popup does not open by itself while
// that is happening, and if a refusal comes while this one is up the notice opens on top of it.
//
// Rendered once, at App level, and reads its own open flag — the same arrangement as the
// storage-full notice, and for the same reason: it can open from any screen. Through the shared
// Popup shell, so it is a normal stacked popup (Escape, Back, the dim, the keyboard's reach and the
// status-bar strip are the shell's) — and app-wide: no screen or panel owns it, so a mode letter
// under it does nothing (components/overlayStack's isAppWidePopupOpen).

// The saved stats' own names for the things solve times are kept for, in the app's words. Each is
// built from the mode's name in lib/modes — the one place a mode is named — so a rename there
// renames it here.

// ★ WHICH OWNERS ARE LISTED BY NAME, AT EVERY SIZE. The list answers "what is using the room", and
// it has to answer it on a device that is nearly empty as well as on one that is nearly full:
//   • every owner holding 1% or more of the room is listed — on a filling device those are the
//     ones worth clearing, and there are never many (at most a hundred, in practice a handful);
//   • and the LARGEST owners are listed whatever they hold, until the list is LISTED_AT_LEAST long.
//     Without that, a device with little on it showed one line — "Everything saved <1%" — which
//     says nothing about what is there; and before the limit is measured there is no percentage to
//     sort anything out by at all.
//   • what is left over is one last line, "Everything else": the many small owners a player with
//     several presets has (each preset × each mode), and the app's own few keys, which are nobody's
//     to clear.
// Largest first, so the line to act on is the first one read.
