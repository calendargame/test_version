// `import * as React` + `const { useEffect, … } = React`. That form defeats the react-hooks /
// React-Compiler ESLint rules' detection: they resolve hooks through the import, so a namespace
// binding makes the WHOLE FILE invisible to them. (This file inherited the bad form from main.tsx,
// which carried it until round 16's B5 — main.tsx now uses named imports too, and the two
// set-state-in-effect violations that had been hiding behind it were fixed rather than suppressed.
// LookupCard.tsx and MethodBreakdown.tsx are the last two files still calling their hooks as
// React.useX, and are still invisible to the rules — see the escalation with round 16. modeHooks
// and useSettingsCloseEffect also write `import * as React`, but ONLY for React.DependencyList in a
// type position; their hooks are named imports, so the rules do see them.)
// Verified by probe in round 14 — swapping this one line back takes `eslint` on this file from
// reporting a genuine react-hooks/set-state-in-effect error (in the Full Reset safety net, see
// ~line 545) to clean. Nothing about the code changes; only whether anything is looking at it.

// ============================================================
// SettingsPanel — the ⚙ popover card and its four modals.
//
// ★ IT IS RENDERED ONLY WHILE THE PANEL IS OPEN: App renders `{settingsOpen && <SettingsPanel …/>}`.
// That is a HARD constraint, not a style choice. A closed panel must have no DOM at all — the test
// suite's role queries are unscoped by design (role queries skip display:none, which is the only
// reason the always-mounted How-to-Play copy does not collide), so an always-mounted-and-hidden
// panel would make getAllByRole('radio') count double and fail in ways that look nothing like the
// cause. It is also what lets the modal state below simply DIE on close instead of needing four
// effects to clear it.
//
// ★ AND ONLY IN ONE PLACE IN THE TREE: as a sibling of the bar's title/gear row, inside the bar's
// `relative` inner wrapper. The card is `absolute left-4 right-4 top-full`, so all three of those
// resolve against that wrapper as containing block — rendered anywhere else, or wrapped in a div of
// its own, the panel silently detaches from the bar. Hence the FRAGMENT below whose first child is
// the card itself. (The `--bar-h` half of the max-height calc is NOT position-dependent: it is a
// root custom property, inherited everywhere.)
//
// ★ IT MUST NOT BE MEMOISED, and it must never call useSettingsCloseEffect.
//   • No React.memo, no useMemo around the element, no memoised props object. PillGroup's tab-stop
//     layout effect and the footer fit's below both deliberately have NO dependency array, because
//     they must re-read the DOM on every pass; memoising the panel out of a render leaves a stale
//     tab stop and a stale fit.
//   • useSettingsCloseEffect seeds its "was open" ref from the FIRST value it sees, so a caller
//     that mounts while the panel is open and unmounts on close never produces a true→false
//     transition and its body NEVER RUNS — silently, with nothing thrown. Every apply-on-close in
//     the app depends on that transition. Its six callers are App and the five always-mounted mode
//     screens, none of which unmount; this component is the one place that must not join them. In
//     particular useUpdateCheck() is called by APP and its result passed in as two props, precisely
//     because it contains one.
//
// WHAT STAYS IN App AND ARRIVES AS PROPS: the panel's open state and every write to it, the
// click-outside / Escape / drag-dismiss listeners (two of the click-outside's three refs live in
// the BAR), the gear-dot retire effect, the four at-defaults booleans the GEAR renders while the
// panel is closed, resetSettings/fullReset (which reach App's whole world), and the Year Range text
// mirrors (whose lifetime must outlive this component's — see useYearRangeMirrors).
//
// WHAT IT READS STRAIGHT FROM THE STORES: the fourteen settings values and their setters, and the
// saved-defaults snapshot. Individually selected, never as one object selector, so the panel
// re-renders only for the value that changed.

  // watches mousedown/touchstart, so no press ever cancels the arm, and if the rest of the app was
  // already fresh then settings returning to default is the thirteenth term falling into place.

  // simultaneously dimmed, announced unavailable and refused by armFullReset's own first line (B7

  // ★ WHY IT ADJUSTS STATE DURING RENDER RATHER THAN IN AN EFFECT. The moved-in version was a
  // useEffect calling disarmFullReset(). That is a setState synchronously inside an effect body —
  // react-hooks/set-state-in-effect, a real error, and it was invisible for as long as this file
  // pulled its hooks off a `React` namespace binding (that form defeats the rule's detection; see
  // the import at the top of this file). Named imports made the file analyzable and the error
  // surfaced on code that had merely MOVED, which is the extraction doing its job. The fix is
  // React's documented replacement for "adjust some state when a prop changes": compare against the
  // previous prop during render and update immediately. React discards the in-progress render
  // instead of committing it, so the committed DOM is the same minus one wasted frame.
  //
  // The 3s arm timer is deliberately NOT cleared here (clearTimeout during render would be an
  // impure side effect, and the compiler is right to reject that shape). It is inert: its callback
  // sets armed false, which it already is, and pressFullReset clears any pending timer before
  // arming again — so it can neither disarm a later arm nor null out a later timer's handle.

  // for the WHOLE popup; Escape on the field is the smaller undo, and a second Escape — with the

  // --mut-color marker). The card is heading row → list → Close and NOTHING else — the heading row
  // gained the app's version on its right on 2026-08-10 (the note at the row explains the markup and
  // why the id moved onto a span), and it is still one row: round-8 Q8 added a
  // one-line "Shows the last ten days with updates." notice between the scroller and Close, and the
  // owner removed it (round-9) on the rule that this popup answers WHAT CHANGED, while how the app
  // keeps its history is documentation — so the ten-day cap is explained in How to Play (the
  // Updates section) and nowhere else. Don't re-add it here. The one-control card is also what

          {/* THE HEADING ROW: "What's new" left, the app's version right (2026-08-10). This popup is
              the version's ONLY home — not the ⚙ panel's "Last Updated" row, which has no space for
              it and which the owner will not give a second line to. Here it costs nothing: it sits
              in the panel someone opens to ask what changed, which is the same question.
              ★ WHY THE ID IS ON A SPAN AND NOT ON THIS ROW — the one thing not to "tidy". The card
              above is aria-labelledby="changelog-title", so whatever carries that id IS the dialog's
              accessible name. Put the id on the row and every screen reader announces the dialog as
              "What's new v2.19.0" on every open, and the name changes on every deploy — a moving
              landmark, and a version number read aloud to someone who did not ask for one. The id
              wraps ONLY the words, so the name stays exactly "What's new" (pinned by
              changelog.dom.test, and the whole suite reaches this dialog through
              getByRole('dialog', { name: "What's new" }), so a regression fails ~30 cases at once).
              The version is still IN the dialog and still read in its content, just not in its name.
              STYLING, decided rather than defaulted: text-xs, normal weight, tabular-nums (so the
              digits do not jitter between versions), and --tx-200-80 — the SAME token the changelog
              entry bullets use, so the version reads as part of this card's text rather than as a
              fourth kind of grey. NOT the muted marker token (--mut-color): that is calibrated for
              decorative punctuation, and this is already demoted three ways (smaller, lighter, and
              sitting beside a bright semibold heading).
              ⚠ THE MEASURED REASON IS NOT THE ONE THAT WAS PREDICTED, so it is written down as
              measured. The muted token was expected to fail on the LIGHT and PARCHMENT themes, which
              have the least contrast headroom. It does not: on those two, --mut-color and
              --tx-200-80 resolve to the same colour and both land at 4.62 / 4.59 against this card.
              The penalty is on the DARK themes, where the muted token is far dimmer than the text
              one — measured against the built app in a real browser, contrast vs the card:
                  --tx-200-80   dusk 9.12  midnight 9.67  slate 8.91  sepia 8.91  light 4.62  parch 4.59
                  --mut-color   dusk 5.69  midnight 5.95  slate 5.61  sepia 5.61  light 4.62  parch 4.59
              So the choice is right and is never worse — it is simply four themes that would have
              paid for it, not two. Every value above clears WCAG AA for normal text (4.5).
              items-baseline, not items-center: the version's baseline sits on the heading's, which is
              what makes two different type sizes read as one line. */}

      {/* ★ THE CARD IS THE FIRST CHILD OF THIS FRAGMENT AND HAS NO WRAPPER. It renders at the bar's
          slot, and it is `absolute left-4 right-4 top-full` against the bar's `relative` inner
          wrapper — an extra div here would become the containing block and detach the panel.
          Elevation + bottom cushion (Calendar Game, refined 2026-06-09): this popover is a FLOATING
          OVERLAY (it pops over the dimmed page), so it uses the app's even, all-around overlay
          shadow — the SAME visual language as the dropdown menus (CustomSelect) — NOT the
          directional `elev-shadow-down` (that one is the scroll-BOUNDARY cue for fixed
          bars/headers/footers, the wrong language for a free-floating panel). It's OFFSET-FREE
          (`0 0 8px`, vs the dropdowns' downward-offset shadow) so the shadow extends EQUALLY on all
          four sides — the panel is inset against the screen edge on every side and must read as
          symmetric. It's SUBTLE (12% black, the app's overlay-shadow color) because the opaque fill
          + 1px card border + dimmed backdrop already separate it (the shadow only adds a gentle
          lift); and SMALL (8px blur) so it stays clearly contained inside the 1rem gap (vs the
          dropdowns' 28px blur, which would overflow the cushion and clip at the screen edge).
          Bottom cushion: the calc uses REM, not px, so it matches the rem-based side insets EXACTLY
          — left-4/right-4 = 1rem, and the app's root font is FLUID (html{font-size:clamp(...)}), so
          1rem ≠ 16px; a hardcoded px cushion would NOT equal the sides and would drift per-device.
          max-height = 100dvh - REAL measured bar height (--bar-h, a ROOT custom property, so it is
          inherited here wherever this renders) - 0.5rem (the mt-2 top gap, so it cancels) - 1rem
          cushion - bottom safe-area → the panel stops exactly 1rem above the viewable-area bottom =
          the SAME gap as its sides, on every device (Safari nav bar, installed-app home indicator,
          Android nav-bar/pill). env(safe-area-inset-bottom) is 0 on iOS (no viewport-fit=cover in
          index.html) — it only matters on edge-to-edge Android. (Tailwind arbitrary value:
          underscores become spaces, so calc() emits the whitespace CSS requires.)
          Press-drag contract (Q5 rework, lib/pointerGestures): the CARD is the ⚙ trigger's menu —
          id="settings-popover" pairs it via the gear's aria-controls (the id IS the pairing; the
          card deliberately carries no [data-select-group], so a drag that STARTS inside it still
          scrolls natively instead of drag-selecting); the whole card is in drag scope, footer rows
          included. data-drag-dismiss opts it into close-on-drag-pick (App's drag-dismiss listener →
          the apply-on-close pass); the data-drag-stay regions (BOTH footer rows — the theme block
          was the third until round-8 dropped it, so a drag-pick on a theme pill now dismisses like
          the date-format pills) opt back out: Full Reset needs its Confirm? tap, Reset Settings
          should show controls snapping to defaults, and Save Defaults opens its confirmation popup
          (which portals OUT of this card, so a drag-release on popup content can never drag-dismiss
          the panel). The Year Range inputs are data-drag-focus (release = focus for typing, panel
          stays open). The inner scroll wrapper is data-drag-scroll — the controller's auto-scroll
          target + edge-band geometry.
          Scroll recipe (Q5 round-7): the wrapper wears SCROLL_REGION_CLASS + scrollFadeClass
          (components/scrollRegion) — this popover IS the reference treatment (card py-4 only, the
          px-4 scrollbar lane inside the scroller, edge fades) every other scroll region now
          shares. */}

            {/* ★ THE PICKER RULE (round-9) — the panel has exactly TWO kinds of control, and each
                gets exactly ONE treatment. State it here, obey it everywhere below:
                  • SWITCH — a setting that is simply on/off (Random Format, Use System Settings,
                    Julian Calendar, Save Stats): label left, ONE On/Off button right.
                  • PICKER — a choice among named alternatives: ONE merged PillTray tray
                    (components/PillTray, where the concentric-housing recipe lives). Where the
                    alternatives fall into named families, each family gets its own centred caption
                    and the trays STACK.
                The housing is what says "these options are mutually exclusive", so it cannot be a
                per-group decoration: a picker drawn as loose gap-separated buttons reads exactly
                like the in-game rows that are genuinely INDEPENDENT toggles (Allow Mistakes,
                One-by-One), which is the confusion the rule exists to remove. Round-8 had trays on
                Date Format and Theme only; round-9 converted the two hold-outs (Input, and the
                three chance rows) — so the panel is now trays and switches, nothing else.
                Caption hierarchy (already correct, don't disturb it): the setting NAME is a
                left-aligned sentence-case sub-label; FAMILY captions are centred uppercase
                SectionLabels. Name → optional family captions → tray(s).
                Date Format is the family case: five ids in two trays, both reading and writing the
                SAME setting, so the half that doesn't hold the active id shows no selected segment.
                The two trays share ONE ROW (round-10 revert of round-9's stack). Theme stacks out
                of NECESSITY — five theme names measured at zero headroom on any phone narrower than
                the owner's — and round-9 mistook that forced layout for a rule and applied it here
                too, costing ~61px of scrolling for consistency with a case that had no choice.
                These labels are m/d/y-sized, so both trays fit a row comfortably at every width we
                ship. THE RULE IS ABOUT HOUSINGS, NOT AXIS: each named family gets its own captioned
                tray; whether the trays sit side by side or stack is a FIT question, answered per
                group. ONE PillGroup spans BOTH trays, on the wrapper that already exists to hold
                them: a group is a CHOICE, not a row, and two groups would each report "nothing
                selected" whenever the live format lived in the other half — and would also split
                one keyboard choice into two tab stops that refuse to arrow into each other. That
                wrapper is also the dim, so the lock provably covers the captions. Written / Numeric
                stay plain captions — the halves ride in the pills' accessible names
                (WRITTEN_FORMATS/NUMERIC_FORMATS), which keeps the two 'MDY's apart. Every picker
                below states its lock ONCE, as PillGroup's `disabled`: the dim, aria-disabled, the
                onChange guard and the tab stops all follow from it. */}

                that value is DORMANT while the OS decides, and App's settingsAtDefaults

                hide behind. The SAME two rows render in both Use-System states — the panel no
                longer changes height when the switch is flipped — and the centered Dark / Light
                captions carry the whole state difference:
                  • Use System ON  — two INDEPENDENT picks (the OS decides which row is live), so
                    each row reads and writes its own store value.
                  • Use System OFF — ONE pick across BOTH rows: both rows read manualTheme, so the
                    row that doesn't hold it shows no selected segment.
                Captions stay CENTERED in both states (left-aligned SectionLabels are reserved for
                the DISPLAY / DATES / STATS headers and would out-rank the "Theme" sub-label above),
                and neither row is marked "in use" — the OS owns that, and a marker would imply the
                app does. NEITHER ROW IS EVER DIMMED, in either state: none of these three
                PillGroups ever takes `disabled`. This is a SHAPE change, not a lock, and dimming or
                hiding the inactive row is a change the owner explicitly rejected.
                No data-drag-stay (round-8, owner's call): a press-drag from the gear that releases
                on a theme pill DISMISSES the panel, exactly like the date-format pills — "if I want
                to change both, I'd just tap settings instead of doing the dragging thing."
                The RADIOGROUPS follow the selection semantics above rather than the two rows, for
                the same reason the date-format trays share one group: a group is a CHOICE. Use
                System ON = two independent picks = two groups. OFF = one pick across both rows =
                ONE group spanning them, so the row that doesn't hold manualTheme isn't announced as
                an empty choice of its own — and one pick answers to one tab stop and one arrow
                walk. The shared wrapper is not an element added to carry a role — it is also what
                supplies the 8px between the rows that the section's space-y-2 gave them as
                siblings. Which of the three wrappers is the real group is exactly which of them is
                NAMED: an unnamed PillGroup is just the div (a radiogroup must have a name to be
                one), so the switch moves the role, the keyboard and nothing else. All five theme
                names are distinct, so no pill needs an ariaLabel. */}

                  — so without a name they announce as two bare, indistinguishable edit boxes.
                  "Earliest"/"Latest" rather than "Minimum"/"Maximum" to match the guide's own
                  framing of the range ("Defaults to 1-10000 AD", GuidePage "Dates — Year Range").
                  Purely additive: no visible label is added, so the row's geometry is untouched.
                  ⚠ These names are also the TEST HANDLE for the two boxes. Do not remove them
                  expecting the suite to catch it by other means: the boxes carry no other stable
                  identity, and the previous handle — data-drag-focus — is a GENERAL press-drag
                  opt-in (src/lib/pointerGestures.ts), so any third control in the panel adopting it
                  would have broken every year-range test at once.
                  ⚠ THE TEXT IN THESE BOXES IS NOT PANEL STATE. It lives in App
                  (components/useYearRangeMirrors) and arrives as the `yearRange` prop, together
                  with the two refs, precisely so a half-typed year survives closing and reopening
                  the panel — which it would not if this component owned it and remounted per open.

                  THROW THE EDIT AWAY: put the committed year back in the box. The revert used to be
                  a plain setValue followed by the blur() below, and the two landed in ONE React
                  batch — so onBlur's commit still closed over the PRE-revert text and committed the

                  the commit's own cannot-parse branch, which is presumably why it went unnoticed.)
                  flushSync lands the revert BEFORE the blur, so the commit that follows re-reads
                  the restored year and is a no-op. currentTarget is captured first because it is
                  only valid during dispatch.

                  the BUBBLE phase) decides "is this press mine?" by asking what has focus — and
                  blur() has already run by then, so it saw an empty answer and closed the panel out
                  from under the edit. stopPropagation says plainly that this input consumed the
                  press. It works because that listener is on DOCUMENT and BUBBLES: React 19
                  attaches its own listener at the root container, so stopping the native event
                  there means document never sees it. The four MODAL Escape handlers are
                  capture-phase and still fire first, which is correct — they carve text inputs out
                  themselves.
                  Escape still BLURS, deliberately. It keeps the pair the author wrote (Enter = keep
                  it and let go, Escape = discard it and let go), it drops the numeric keyboard on a
                  phone, and it leaves a second Escape free to close the panel — a dismissal ladder,
                  rather than an input that swallows Escape forever. */}

                the JULIAN pair last. Julian Chance is locked unless the switch is ON *and* the
                range straddles 1582, so under any ordinary modern range it is a greyed-out dead
                control; it used to sit third, ABOVE two live ones. Two pairings constrain any
                future reshuffle: Jan/Feb Chance is a sub-case of Leap Year Chance and must sit
                directly under it, and the Julian switch is the thing that explains why Julian
                Chance greys out, so it must stay directly above it. Move the Julian pair, never one
                half of it.
                The three chance rows (this one, Jan/Feb under it, and Julian Chance at the foot of
                the section) are pickers, so they are trays (THE PICKER RULE, Display above) —
                round-9 converted them from the flat gap-separated buttons they shipped as. The
                conversion costs no height: these rows already captioned ABOVE their control, and
                the tray's ~2px seams are tighter than the ~6px gaps they replace, so every label
                gained room. Each row's LOCK now sits on the GROUP instead of on every button, so
                the housing greys as one piece; the caption stays lit, as it always did. Each lock
                is written straight into `disabled` because one boolean is now all a lock takes —
                the IIFEs the two locked rows (Leap Year Chance, Julian Chance) used to need existed
                only to hand the same derived boolean to a dim class as well.

                  (b) ANNOUNCED unavailable — aria-disabled, so a screen reader stops calling it an
                      ordinary button while it does nothing;
                  (c) INERT — the handler guard inside each onClick, which round 14 added and which
                      is the only one of the three that is actually the BEHAVIOUR.
                Belt and braces on purpose: (a) and (b) are what the user is told, (c) is what is
                true. Delete any one of them and the other two start lying.
                ⚠ AND (b) DOES ONE MORE JOB, off this file: lib/pointerGestures reads aria-disabled
                to decide these are not gesture targets, so a press-drag from the ⚙ gear neither
                rings one under the finger nor synthesizes a click on it. That job used to belong to
                the pointer-events-none this round removed — see NOT_OFFERED_BTN_CLASS. So the
                attribute is load-bearing twice over; it is not decoration you can drop for a
                `title` or a tooltip.
                ⚠ aria-disabled AND NOT `disabled`, decided on evidence and not on taste:
                  • It is already this app's convention — PillGroup, PillTray, SliderValueEditor and
                    MethodBreakdown's Show Codes all withhold with aria-disabled, and index.css
                    names `.btn-solid[aria-disabled="true"]` FIRST in its unavailable rule. The one
                    real `disabled` is Check for updates, which is a different thing: momentarily
                    busy, not conditionally meaningless.
                  • A real `disabled` DROPS FOCUS when it is applied to the focused element. These
                    three go dim as a RESULT of being pressed — press Reset Settings and it dims
                    itself — so a keyboard user would be thrown back to <body> by their own
                    successful action. aria-disabled leaves focus where it is and re-announces.
                  • It keeps them discoverable. `disabled` removes them from the tab order outright,
                    which trades "reachable but silent" for "not there at all"; the complaint B7
                    fixes is the silence, not the reachability.
                  • And it keeps the guards TESTABLE: jsdom refuses to dispatch activation on a real
                    `disabled` button, so the net could no longer ask what pressing a dimmed button
                    does — the exact question round 14's guards exist to answer.
                Save Defaults (Q7) is constructive → btn-solid purple (the Begin-button language),
                keeping rose exclusively for the two destructive neighbors. It dims when live state
                already equals the saved defaults (factory when none saved) — nothing new to save.
                Each caption sits in a data-fitlabel span (whitespace-nowrap so it MEASURES at full
                width instead of wrapping; overflow-hidden on the button contains the pre-fit
                paint). */}

              the ONLY way back to factory semantics (the Save Defaults popup's duplicate link was

              (Cancel + a red-tier Clear, above) instead of firing immediately.
              This footer row (the same muted tier as Check for updates below) is always reachable:
              the Save Defaults button dims + locks exactly when live == saved, but the footer never
              hides behind it. FIRST link row, directly under the button trio (Round-2): these are
              the only actionable settings in this block, and they belong to the trio's story —
              below it the footer decays into contact info and metadata.
              The row inherits the footer's data-drag-stay, so a drag-release on either link acts

            {/* Check for a newer deployed version and apply it if there is one (Q7, round 11 — it
                used to reload unconditionally). The state machine behind it is App's
                (components/useUpdateCheck, called there and never here — it contains a
                useSettingsCloseEffect, which would never fire from a component that unmounts on
                close); this is only its button. Styled like the Contact email link above (inherits
                the footer's text-(--tx-300-60)) so it matches the surrounding footer text on every
                theme, with three deliberate departures:
                  • THE HIDDEN STRUT. The button is a one-cell grid holding the resting label twice
                    — an aria-hidden copy that only reserves width, and the live label stacked on
                    it. So the button is always exactly as wide as "Check for updates" (the longest
                    of the four by construction — lib/updateCheck pins it) and the Changelog link
                    beside it can never shift when the label changes. justify-items-CENTER splits
                    the slack evenly, so each shorter label sits centred in the gap between the Last
                    Updated stamp and Changelog rather than hugging one edge (owner's call
                    2026-08-02, overriding an earlier justify-items-start that anchored them left).
                    The resting label is the widest, so it fills the cell exactly and centring
                    cannot move it — only the three status labels shift, which is the whole point.
                    Note the CENTRE is the button's own fixed cell, NOT the row: it stays put
                    however wide the date in the timestamp renders, so nothing here is
                    position-dependent on that.
                  • UNDERLINE ONLY AT REST. The other three labels are STATUS, not actions; wearing
                    the interaction signal while not being the interaction is the round-3
                    block-hover mistake. The button still IS pressable during a result — a tap
                    starts another check — but it is not offering the same thing, so it does not
                    claim to.
                  • DISABLED while checking, so the state the label reports is the state the control
                    is in. The NATIVE disabled attribute, deliberately — the suite pins `.disabled`
                    and a swap to aria-disabled fails there on purpose. No aria-live: a tap leaves
                    focus on the button, where the accessible name changing is announced anyway, and
                    a live region inside a control double-announces on some screen readers — an
                    unverifiable trade for no gain. */}

                together, force-the-latest then read-what-changed. Same footer-link recipe, in a row
                wearing the same shared FOOTER_LINK_ROW_CLASS as the View/Clear row above (round-7
                Q2 — this row's legacy gap-2 left its rings touching at 0px clearance vs the ~4px
                above); wears the INLINE UpdateDot until its first tap after a build change — the
                second stage of the breadcrumb the gear's dot starts.
                Round-8 Q7 rebuilt that marker: a text link reserves no room for the gear's corner
                badge, so the round-6 shared recipe put the dot on top of the word. The link is an
                inline-flex row now — the text in its own span, the marker its sibling — and the
                underline moved ONTO that span so the rule can never paint across the gap. The
                marker's slot is reserved lit or not (index.css), so lighting up shifts nothing;
                being aria-hidden, it needs the sr-only word beside it to reach a screen reader,
                which is also the only update signal left once the gear's dot has been retired.
                ⚠ That word carries its own COMMA rather than the gear's "(update)" parenthetical:
                the name-from-content algorithm trims each child's text before joining them, so a
                leading space is dropped and the two would run together ("Changelog(update)"). A
                printing separator is the only one that survives the join. */}
