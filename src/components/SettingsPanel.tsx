// LookupCard.tsx and MethodBreakdown.tsx are the last two files still calling their hooks as
// React.useX, and are still invisible to the rules — see the escalation with round 16. modeHooks
// and useSettingsCloseEffect also write `import * as React`, but ONLY for React.DependencyList in a
// type position; their hooks are named imports, so the rules do see them.)
// Verified by probe in round 14 — swapping this one line back takes `eslint` on this file from
// reporting a genuine react-hooks/set-state-in-effect error (in the Full Reset safety net, see
// ~line 545) to clean. Nothing about the code changes; only whether anything is looking at it.

// ============================================================
// SettingsPanel — the ⚙ popover card and its modals: Save Defaults, the defaults manager, the
// Changelog and the preset manager, plus three shared ConfirmModals (Full Reset, Reset Settings,
// Clear Saved Defaults) since round 21.
//
// ★ IT IS RENDERED ONLY WHILE THE PANEL IS OPEN: App renders `{settingsOpen && <SettingsPanel …/>}`.
// That is a HARD constraint, not a style choice. A closed panel must have no DOM at all — the test
// suite's role queries are unscoped by design (role queries skip display:none, which is the only
// reason the always-mounted How-to-Play copy does not collide), so an always-mounted-and-hidden
// panel would make getAllByRole('radio') count double and fail in ways that look nothing like the
// cause. It is also what lets the modal state below simply DIE on close instead of needing four
// effects to clear it.
//
// ★ AND ONLY IN ONE PLACE IN THE TREE: as a sibling of the bar's title/gear row, inside the bar's
// `relative` inner wrapper. The card is `absolute left-4 right-4 top-full`, so all three of those
// resolve against that wrapper as containing block — rendered anywhere else, or wrapped in a div of
// its own, the panel silently detaches from the bar. Hence the FRAGMENT below whose first child is
// the card itself. (The `--bar-h` half of the max-height calc is NOT position-dependent: it is a
// root custom property, inherited everywhere.)
//
// ★ IT MUST NOT BE MEMOISED, and it must never call useSettingsCloseEffect.
//   • No React.memo, no useMemo around the element, no memoised props object. PillGroup's tab-stop
//     layout effect and the footer fit's below both deliberately have NO dependency array, because
//     they must re-read the DOM on every pass; memoising the panel out of a render leaves a stale
//     tab stop and a stale fit.
//   • useSettingsCloseEffect seeds its "was open" ref from the FIRST value it sees, so a caller
//     that mounts while the panel is open and unmounts on close never produces a true→false
//     transition and its body NEVER RUNS — silently, with nothing thrown. Every apply-on-close in
//     the app depends on that transition. Its six callers are App and the five always-mounted mode
//     screens, none of which unmount; this component is the one place that must not join them. In
//     particular useUpdateCheck() is called by APP and its result passed in as two props, precisely
//     because it contains one.
//
// WHAT STAYS IN App AND ARRIVES AS PROPS: the panel's open state and every write to it, its entry in
// the app's stack of open things with its press-outside rule (three of that rule's four refs live
// in the BAR), the drag-dismiss listener, the gear-dot retire effect, the four at-defaults booleans the GEAR renders while the
// panel is closed, resetSettings/fullReset (which reach App's whole world), and the Year Range text
// mirrors (whose lifetime must outlive this component's — see useYearRangeMirrors).
//
// WHAT IT READS STRAIGHT FROM THE STORES: the sixteen settings values and their setters, and the
// saved-defaults snapshot. Individually selected, never as one object selector, so the panel
// re-renders only for the value that changed.

  // and not the stats; Full: none of it. They are ORTHOGONAL, not exclusive — in an amnesic preset
  // you may still want Save Stats off for throwaway questions so even the session's count does not
  // move. Folding the two into one picker (Saved / Amnesic / Off) was proposed and the owner
  // correctly killed it: it would have made two independent facts look like one choice. (Amnesic's
  // OWN three values are one fact — how much lasts — which is why it is a picker and Save Stats
  // stays a switch; and Save Stats has no matching middle value, by the owner's ruling.)
  //
  // ⚠ NOT A ⚙ SETTING, despite living in the ⚙ panel. The value is held per preset for the browsing
  // session (store/sessionAmnesic), so it is read from there and written through
  // store/presetControl — which pairs the write with the storage work it implies. The reasons are
  // argued in full at the top of store/amnesic; the one that matters here is that a settings value
  // can be overwritten wholesale by Reset Settings, with no rehydration and no screen remount, and
  // this value decides WHICH STORAGE the stats and bests are read from.
  // ⚠⚠ WHERE IT LIVES IS NOT WHETHER IT COUNTS, AND THIS COMMENT USED TO CONFLATE THE TWO. It said
  // two things followed from the value not being a settings value: that it is not in the Save
  // Defaults snapshot, and that it never lights the gear's "modified" bar. BOTH WERE WRONG, in two
  // separate rounds. Round 20 put it IN the snapshot (commitSaveDefaults below writes it, and Reset
  // Settings / Full Reset restore it), and round 22 put it into the comparison that lights the
  // bar (main.tsx's settingsAtDefaults) — because leaving it out of ONE shared expression that also
  // dims Save Defaults meant an amnesic-only change could never be saved as a default at all. So

  // list", and a second dismiss closes the card: the dismissal LADDER (dismissPresets below), the
  // same shape the rename field has always had (the first Escape belongs to the name, the second to
  // the card).
  // A ladder is a decision about a dismiss, and the dismiss handlers are this component's — it
  // hands the popup its onDismiss, as it does for the other popups. So this is the fact the

  // to ask. The card takes it as a prop and stays the owner of everything that is genuinely about
  // drawing the two views.
  // ⚠ AN ID, NOT THE PRESET OBJECT, for the reason the card's own version was an id: the registry

  // dirty-row accent live; see its header comment): row labels are Title Case (the ⚙ panel's label
  // tier) with every paired aria-label mirroring its visible text exactly — no case drift to

  // src/changelog), so what the module holds is exactly what a visitor downloads and exactly what
  // draws here — no entry ships only to be refused. The list sits inside its own scroll region on

  // the title and scroll region each carry px-4, so the scroller's 1rem right padding
  // is the text-free lane the iOS scrollbar paints in; SCROLL_REGION_CLASS + scrollFadeClass (fed
  // by the changelogScrollRef edge listener up with the popover's) add the edge fades, and max-h
  // keeps a long history scrolling within the card without growing it off-screen. Entry dates
  // render through the footer's Last-Updated recipe (fmt + numericFormatOf) so they follow the
  // user's Date Format setting; the bullet list is the guide's UL idiom (list-disc + the
  // --mut-color marker). The card is heading row → list and NOTHING else — the heading row
  // gained the app's version on its right on 2026-08-10 (the note at the row explains the markup and
  // why the id moved onto a span), and it is still one row: a one-line "Shows the last ten days
  // with updates." notice once sat below the scroller, and the owner removed it on the rule that this popup answers WHAT CHANGED, while how the app

              in the panel someone opens to ask what changed, which is the same question.
              ★ WHY THE ID IS ON A SPAN AND NOT ON THIS ROW — the one thing not to "tidy". The card
              above is aria-labelledby="changelog-title", so whatever carries that id IS the dialog's
              accessible name. Put the id on the row and every screen reader announces the dialog as
              "What's new v2.19.0" on every open, and the name changes on every deploy — a moving
              landmark, and a version number read aloud to someone who did not ask for one. The id
              wraps ONLY the words, so the name stays exactly "What's new" (pinned by
              changelog.dom.test, and the whole suite reaches this dialog through
              getByRole('dialog', { name: "What's new" }), so a regression fails ~30 cases at once).
              The version is still IN the dialog and still read in its content, just not in its name.
              STYLING, decided rather than defaulted: text-xs, normal weight, tabular-nums (so the
              digits do not jitter between versions), and --tx-200-80 — the SAME token the changelog
              entry bullets use, so the version reads as part of this card's text rather than as a
              fourth kind of grey. NOT the muted marker token (--mut-color): that is calibrated for
              decorative punctuation, and this is already demoted three ways (smaller, lighter, and
              sitting beside a bright semibold heading).
              ⚠ THE MEASURED REASON IS NOT THE ONE THAT WAS PREDICTED, so it is written down as
              measured. The muted token was expected to fail on the LIGHT and PARCHMENT themes, which
              have the least contrast headroom. It does not: on those two, --mut-color and
              --tx-200-80 resolve to the same colour and both land at 4.62 / 4.59 against this card.
              The penalty is on the DARK themes, where the muted token is far dimmer than the text
              one — measured against the built app in a real browser, contrast vs the card:
                  --tx-200-80   dusk 9.12  midnight 9.67  slate 8.91  sepia 8.91  light 4.62  parch 4.59
                  --mut-color   dusk 5.69  midnight 5.95  slate 5.61  sepia 5.61  light 4.62  parch 4.59
              So the choice is right and is never worse — it is simply four themes that would have
              paid for it, not two. Every value above clears WCAG AA for normal text (4.5).
              items-baseline, not items-center: the version's baseline sits on the heading's, which is

          directional `elev-shadow-down` (that one is the scroll-BOUNDARY cue for fixed
          bars/headers/footers, the wrong language for a free-floating panel). It's OFFSET-FREE
          (`0 0 8px`, vs the dropdowns' downward-offset shadow) so the shadow extends EQUALLY on all
          four sides — the panel is inset against the screen edge on every side and must read as
          symmetric. It's SUBTLE (12% black, the app's overlay-shadow color) because the card's fill
          + 1px card border already separate it (the shadow only adds a gentle lift). That fill is
          SOLID in every theme (--card-bg, index.css), so nothing on the page behind shows through
          this panel; and SMALL (8px blur) so it stays clearly contained inside the 1rem gap (vs
          the dropdowns' 28px blur, which would overflow the cushion and clip at the screen edge).
          Bottom cushion: the calc uses REM, not px, so it matches the rem-based side insets EXACTLY
          — left-4/right-4 = 1rem, and the app's root font is FLUID (html{font-size:clamp(...)}), so
          1rem ≠ 16px; a hardcoded px cushion would NOT equal the sides and would drift per-device.
          max-height = 100dvh - REAL measured bar height (--bar-h, a ROOT custom property, so it is
          inherited here wherever this renders) - 0.5rem (the mt-2 top gap, so it cancels) - 1rem
          cushion - bottom safe-area → the panel stops exactly 1rem above the viewable-area bottom =
          the SAME gap as its sides, on every device (Safari nav bar, installed-app home indicator,
          Android nav-bar/pill). env(safe-area-inset-bottom) is 0 on iOS (no viewport-fit=cover in
          index.html) — it only matters on edge-to-edge Android. (Tailwind arbitrary value:
          underscores become spaces, so calc() emits the whitespace CSS requires.)
          Press-drag contract (lib/pointerGestures): the CARD is the ⚙ trigger's menu —
          id="settings-popover" pairs it via the gear's aria-controls (the id IS the pairing; the
          card deliberately carries no [data-select-group], so a drag that STARTS inside it still
          scrolls natively instead of drag-selecting); the whole card is in drag scope, footer rows
          included. data-drag-dismiss opts it into close-on-drag-pick (App's drag-dismiss listener →
          the apply-on-close pass); the data-drag-stay regions (BOTH footer rows — the theme block
          was the third until round-8 dropped it, so a drag-pick on a theme pill now dismisses like
          the date-format pills) opt back out: Save Defaults, Reset Settings and Full Reset each
          open a confirmation popup (all of which portal OUT of this card, so a drag-release on
          popup content can never drag-dismiss the panel), and the panel has to stay up behind
          them; the View / Clear Saved Defaults links are the same. The Year Range inputs are data-drag-focus (release = focus for typing, panel
          stays open). The inner scroll wrapper is data-drag-scroll — the controller's auto-scroll
          target + edge-band geometry.
          Scroll recipe (round 7): the wrapper wears SCROLL_REGION_CLASS + scrollFadeClass
          (components/scrollRegion) — this popover IS the reference treatment (card py-4 only, the
          px-4 scrollbar lane inside the scroller, edge fades) every other scroll region now
          shares.
          focus-scope: the keyboard's ring is drawn on whichever control in here has it (index.css,
          "THE KEYBOARD FOCUS RING") — the same scope every popup's scrim is. */}

              regroup. */}
          {/* ── GLOBAL — THE PANEL'S FIRST SECTION, AND FIRST IS THE ARGUMENT ─────────────────
              This section holds what belongs to the WHOLE APP rather than to one preset: which
              preset a fresh open lands in ("Open in"), and the door to Manage Presets (inherently
              cross-preset). Everything BELOW the "Per-preset" label is the current preset's alone.
              That split is the owner's one-line rule ("only the current preset, ALL settings apply
              to that preset only including defaults and all that") drawn as layout rather than
              buried in a sentence — and round 21 made it explicit by giving the global items
              their own header instead of filing them under "Presets" with the rest.
              ★★ AND ROUND 22 GAVE THAT SPLIT ITS OWN VISUAL TIER, because until then it had
              none: "Global" and "Per-preset" were drawn as plain left-aligned SectionLabels, the
              SAME rank as the Display / Dates / Stats headers nested underneath them, above an
              identical section divider. The panel therefore LOOKED like five peer sections when it
              is really two groups with three categories inside the second. Both headings are
              GroupLabels now — centered, larger, semibold, brighter — and the divider above
              "Per-preset" is the panel's only heavy one. The three-tier rule, and why tier 1 and
              tier 3 may both be centered without colliding, is written out in components/
              primitives beside the two class strings that draw it.
              ⚠ IT IS WHY Display WEARS `pt-3 border-t` — the divider separates sections; Display is
              no longer the panel's first, so it is no longer the exception.
              ⚠ THE LINE OF PROSE IS NOT DUPLICATION OF THE GUIDE. How to Play explains what a
              preset IS and what Save Defaults captures; this says which preset you are in, that the
              three buttons at the foot of THIS card act on it, and that "Open in" does not — a
              question asked by someone whose finger is already over Full Reset.
              THE MANAGE PRESETS BUTTON is a full-width `surface-toggle` — the app's no-fill
              interactive recipe (shared with View/Clear Saved Defaults below and with the manager's
              own row controls) at the panel's control tier (text-xs, py-1.5), not btn-solid: opening
              a manager is
              neither constructive nor destructive, and violet in this panel means "this saves
              something" (Save Defaults). It is deliberately NOT drawn as a switch row — THE PICKER
              RULE below reserves label-left/one-button-right for on/off settings. */}
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <GroupLabel>Global</GroupLabel>
            <div className="text-xs text-(--tx-200-80)">
              You are on <b>{activePresetName}</b>. The three buttons at the foot of this card, and

              whole app.

                store/presetControl's setOpenInPreset).
                ★★ A DROPDOWN, NOT A TRAY, SINCE ROUND 23 — the one exception THE PICKER RULE
                below now names, and the reason is that presets are UNLIMITED. A tray has one segment
                per option, so its height grew with the preset count, and pill rows were rejected
                outright: at 10 presets there are 11 options, and any fixed per-row count leaves a lone
                orphan on the last row. The owner's requirement was that this control "should stay
                the same height", so the list lives in a panel that FLOATS over the ⚙ card (nothing in
                it moves when the list opens) and the closed trigger is one row whose height no
                preset count can change. It is the SAME control as the top-bar preset switcher —
                components/CustomSelect, the same list drawn by the same PresetOptionLabel — so it is
                learned once. A popup (scrim + card) was considered and turned down: heavier than
                "pick one from a list".
                • CustomSelect HOLDS THE ⚙ CARD'S SCROLL REGION STILL while this list is open — its
                  panel is fixed to where the trigger was when it opened, so the trigger must not move
                  (CustomSelect's caller contract, whose second route this is the first user of).
                • No pressDrag: this trigger is not the start of a gesture. A press-drag from the ⚙
                  that releases HERE clicks it, which opens the list rather than picking from it —
                  the owner accepted that cost; it is the Year Range boxes' pattern (release, then
                  type). And because that click must not take the panel down with it (the card is
                  data-drag-dismiss, like the Manage Presets button below), the wrapper carries
                  data-drag-stay — without it the release would open the list and close the panel
                  that holds it in the same breath.
                • The trigger wears the tray's own housing (border, surface-tray, rounded-xl, the
                  text-xs control tier) so it sits in this panel's rhythm at the height the tray's
                  single row had; the ▲▼ chevron is the switcher's, and says "this opens a list". */}

                press-drag that starts on the gear and releases on a control inside it clicks the
                control AND closes the panel (lib/pointerGestures: `menu.hasAttribute
                ('data-drag-dismiss') && !member.closest('[data-drag-stay]')`). That is right for a
                setting — release on a theme pill and the panel gets out of the way — and it is
                catastrophic for a MODAL OPENER: the panel closing unmounts this component, and the
                modal it just opened goes with it, so the gesture would look like a button that does
                nothing. The ⚙ footer already carries this attribute for exactly this reason (its
                Save Defaults, View/Clear Saved Defaults and Changelog links all open modals); this
                is the first modal opener OUTSIDE that footer, so it has to say it for itself. */}

              leaving it to How to Play. Default Mode — the page this preset opens on — is the first
              such setting and lives right under the label; it IS captured by Save Defaults, which
              the caption states so the reader does not have to cross-reference the guide.
              ★★ THE PANEL'S ONE HEAVY DIVIDER, and it is the ONLY place `border-t-2` and the
              --bd-500-40 tone appear in this card: every section divider below is `border-t` on
              --bd-500-20, so this rule is twice the weight and twice the contrast of any of them,
              with pt-4 rather than pt-3 under it. That is the whole difference between "another
              section starts here" and "the panel's second half starts here", and it is why the
              treatment is written inline rather than lifted into a shared constant — a constant
              would invite a second user, and a second heavy rule is exactly what would stop this
              one reading as THE split.
              ★★ AND IT REALLY DOES SPAN THE CARD, EDGE TO EDGE — `-mx-4 px-4` on this div, which is
              what the owner asked for and what an earlier draft of this comment wrongly claimed was
              impossible. That draft reasoned that a scroll container clips overflow past its
              inline-START edge and cannot scroll to it, so the rule's left 1rem would vanish while
              its right survived. The premise is real and the conclusion does not follow, because
              NOTHING OVERFLOWS: the scroller carries the px-4 lane (components/scrollRegion — the
              card owns py-4 only), a −1rem margin reaches exactly its PADDING edge, and the padding
              box IS the clipping box. Measured in a real browser at 375px rather than argued:
              scrollWidth stays equal to clientWidth (no horizontal overflow appears, so no second
              scrollbar and nothing unreachable), and the rule lands flush on both of the card's
              inner edges.
              ⚠ THE px-4 PUTS THE SECTION'S CONTENTS BACK IN THE COLUMN the negative margin took
              them out of, to the pixel — every control below this label lines up with every control
              above it, exactly as before. It is deliberately the ONE line in the card that reaches
              the edges: that is the whole difference between "another section starts here" and "the
              panel's second half starts here", and every other divider stays in the column. */}

                gets exactly ONE treatment. State it here, obey it everywhere below:
                  • SWITCH — a setting that is simply on/off (Random Format, Use System Settings,
                    Julian Calendar, Save Stats): label left, ONE On/Off button right.
                  • PICKER — a choice among named alternatives: ONE merged PillTray tray
                    (components/PillTray, where the concentric-housing recipe lives). Where the
                    alternatives fall into named families, each family gets its own centred caption
                    and the trays STACK.
                The housing is what says "these options are mutually exclusive", so it cannot be a
                per-group decoration: a picker drawn as loose gap-separated buttons reads exactly
                like the in-game rows that are genuinely INDEPENDENT toggles (Allow Mistakes,
                One-by-One), which is the confusion the rule exists to remove. Round-8 had trays on
                Date Format and Theme only; round-9 converted the two hold-outs (Input, and the
                three chance rows) — so the panel is now trays and switches, with ONE exception:
                  • DROPDOWN — a choice among an OPEN-ENDED list, whose length the player decides.
                    Exactly one: "Open in" (round 23), because presets are unlimited and a tray
                    grows a segment per option. It is argued at the control, above.
                Caption hierarchy (already correct, don't disturb it): the setting NAME is a
                left-aligned sentence-case sub-label; FAMILY captions are centred uppercase
                SectionLabels — tier 3 of the panel's three-tier heading rule, stated in
                components/primitives. Name → optional family captions → tray(s).
                Date Format is the family case: five ids in two trays, both reading and writing the
                SAME setting, so the half that doesn't hold the active id shows no selected segment.
                The two trays share ONE ROW (round-10 revert of round-9's stack). Theme stacks out
                of NECESSITY — five theme names measured at zero headroom on any phone narrower than
                the owner's — and round-9 mistook that forced layout for a rule and applied it here
                too, costing ~61px of scrolling for consistency with a case that had no choice.
                These labels are m/d/y-sized, so both trays fit a row comfortably at every width we
                ship. THE RULE IS ABOUT HOUSINGS, NOT AXIS: each named family gets its own captioned
                tray; whether the trays sit side by side or stack is a FIT question, answered per
                group. ONE PillGroup spans BOTH trays, on the wrapper that already exists to hold
                them: a group is a CHOICE, not a row, and two groups would each report "nothing
                selected" whenever the live format lived in the other half — and would also split
                one keyboard choice into two tab stops that refuse to arrow into each other. That
                wrapper is also the dim, so the lock provably covers the captions. Written / Numeric
                stay plain captions — the halves ride in the pills' accessible names
                (WRITTEN_FORMATS/NUMERIC_FORMATS), which keeps the two 'MDY's apart. Every picker
                below states its lock ONCE, as PillGroup's `disabled`: the dim, aria-disabled, the
                onChange guard and the tab stops all follow from it. */}

                CHANGED: two named options (Columns / Rows) were a PillTray until round 20
                recognised them as an on/off shape and made them a SWITCH; round 23 added 45°,
                and three named alternatives are a PICKER again — one tray, no families, like
                Input above it. The row name is "Rotate Dots" rather than round 21's "Rotate Dots
                CCW" (the owner's call then, reversing an older "not labelled Rotate" argument —
                the plain-language win beat the word's second meaning on RotateOverlay's
                turn-your-device screen): the direction now rides in the pills themselves, so
                saying it twice would only crowd the row.
                ★ IT LOCKS WHENEVER THERE ARE NO DOTS ON SCREEN TO TURN, which is two conditions and
                not one: Deduction (whose answers are not weekdays at all — the same
                `mode === 'deduction'` the Input picker above uses, shared on purpose, because a
                live control sitting directly beneath a dead one, both about dots, would read as a
                bug in the lock), and ANY mode while Input is on Buttons — the second half is what
                makes the mark's own fix (main.tsx's W5Logo call site) necessary in the first place:
                with Input on Buttons there is nothing on screen for a turned mark to correspond to,
                so the CONTROL that could turn it locks too, not just the mark itself. Stated once,
                as PillGroup's `disabled`, like every other picker.
                ⚠ IT IS A LOCK, NOT A RESET — value preserved while locked, exactly how Julian Chance
                behaves when the year range makes it moot and exactly how Amnesic behaves while Save
                Stats is off. Switch Input back to Dots and the rotation you chose is still
                selected.
                ⚠ THE LOCK AND THE MARK ARE GATED ON DIFFERENT THINGS, written down so it is not later
                reported as a bug: this picker locks on Deduction OR Input-on-Buttons, while the
                title-bar mark is gated on Input alone (main.tsx passes `<W5Logo>` the setting only
                while `inputStyle==='dots'`). So on Buttons the mark is upright in every mode; and
                in Deduction with Input on Dots the picker is locked but the mark still shows the
                rotation chosen. How to Play says exactly this. */}

                hide behind. The SAME two rows render in both Use-System states — the panel no
                longer changes height when the switch is flipped — and the centered Dark / Light
                captions carry the whole state difference:
                  • Use System ON  — two INDEPENDENT picks (the OS decides which row is live), so
                    each row reads and writes its own store value.
                  • Use System OFF — ONE pick across BOTH rows: both rows read manualTheme, so the
                    row that doesn't hold it shows no selected segment.
                Captions stay CENTERED in both states — they are TIER 3 of the panel's three-tier
                heading rule (components/primitives states it in full beside the classes that draw
                it): a centered SectionLabel is a sub-label naming one FAMILY inside a single
                setting, and the left-aligned spelling is reserved for the DISPLAY / DATES / STATS
                category headers a tier above, which a left-aligned caption here would out-rank.
                ⚠ ROUND 22 ADDED A TIER ABOVE BOTH — the centered, larger, semibold GroupLabels
                on "Global" and "Per-preset" — and it did NOT relax this rule: the whole reason that
                tier is its own component with its own class string is that tier 1 and tier 3 share
                an ALIGNMENT and must never share anything else, so a caption that grew weight or
                size would be the collision this note exists to prevent.
                Neither row is marked "in use" — the OS owns that, and a marker would imply the
                app does. NEITHER ROW IS EVER DIMMED, in either state: none of these three
                PillGroups ever takes `disabled`. This is a SHAPE change, not a lock, and dimming or
                hiding the inactive row is a change the owner explicitly rejected.
                No data-drag-stay (round-8, owner's call): a press-drag from the gear that releases
                on a theme pill DISMISSES the panel, exactly like the date-format pills — "if I want
                to change both, I'd just tap settings instead of doing the dragging thing."
                The RADIOGROUPS follow the selection semantics above rather than the two rows, for
                the same reason the date-format trays share one group: a group is a CHOICE. Use
                System ON = two independent picks = two groups. OFF = one pick across both rows =
                ONE group spanning them, so the row that doesn't hold manualTheme isn't announced as
                an empty choice of its own — and one pick answers to one tab stop and one arrow
                walk. The shared wrapper is not an element added to carry a role — it is also what
                supplies the 8px between the rows that the section's space-y-2 gave them as
                siblings. Which of the three wrappers is the real group is exactly which of them is
                NAMED: an unnamed PillGroup is just the div (a radiogroup must have a name to be
                one), so the switch moves the role, the keyboard and nothing else. All five theme
                names are distinct, so no pill needs an ariaLabel. */}

                  and a "→" between them, neither of which a screen reader attaches to either input
                  — so without a name they announce as two bare, indistinguishable edit boxes.
                  "Earliest"/"Latest" rather than "Minimum"/"Maximum" to match the guide's own
                  framing of the range ("Defaults to 1-10000 AD", GuidePage "Dates — Year Range").
                  Purely additive: no visible label is added, so the row's geometry is untouched.
                  ⚠ These names are also the TEST HANDLE for the two boxes. Do not remove them
                  expecting the suite to catch it by other means: the boxes carry no other stable
                  identity, and the previous handle — data-drag-focus — is a GENERAL press-drag
                  opt-in (src/lib/pointerGestures.ts), so any third control in the panel adopting it
                  would have broken every year-range test at once.
                  ⚠ THE TEXT IN THESE BOXES IS NOT PANEL STATE. It lives in App
                  (components/useYearRangeMirrors) and arrives as the `yearRange` prop, together
                  with the two refs, precisely so a half-typed year survives closing and reopening
                  the panel — which it would not if this component owned it and remounted per open.
                  The committed years (minY/maxY) come straight from the store, as everywhere else
                  in the panel. */}

                  it did neither of these things before, and the intent had always been to).
                  THROW THE EDIT AWAY: put the committed year back in the box. The revert used to be
                  a plain setValue followed by the blur() below, and the two landed in ONE React
                  batch — so onBlur's commit still closed over the PRE-revert text and committed the
                  very value Escape was discarding. (Only unparseable text appeared to revert, via
                  the commit's own cannot-parse branch, which is presumably why it went unnoticed.)
                  flushSync lands the revert BEFORE the blur, so the commit that follows re-reads
                  the restored year and is a no-op. currentTarget is captured first because it is
                  only valid during dispatch.
                  AND KEEP THE PANEL OPEN: Escape also closes the top open layer — this panel
                  (components/overlayStack) — but that rule stands aside while a text box has the
                  keyboard, which is what leaves this press to the box.
                  Escape still BLURS, deliberately. It keeps the pair the author wrote (Enter = keep
                  it and let go, Escape = discard it and let go), it drops the numeric keyboard on a
                  phone, and it leaves a second Escape free to close the panel — a dismissal ladder,
                  rather than an input that swallows Escape forever. */}

                control; it used to sit third, ABOVE two live ones. Two pairings constrain any
                future reshuffle: Jan/Feb Chance is a sub-case of Leap Year Chance and must sit
                directly under it, and the Julian switch is the thing that explains why Julian
                Chance greys out, so it must stay directly above it. Move the Julian pair, never one
                half of it.
                The three chance rows (this one, Jan/Feb under it, and Julian Chance at the foot of

                round-9 converted them from the flat gap-separated buttons they shipped as. The
                conversion costs no height: these rows already captioned ABOVE their control, and
                the tray's ~2px seams are tighter than the ~6px gaps they replace, so every label
                gained room. Each row's LOCK now sits on the GROUP instead of on every button, so
                the housing greys as one piece; the caption stays lit, as it always did. Each lock
                is written straight into `disabled` because one boolean is now all a lock takes —
                the IIFEs the two locked rows (Leap Year Chance, Julian Chance) used to need existed
                only to hand the same derived boolean to a dim class as well.

                  (b) ANNOUNCED unavailable — aria-disabled, so a screen reader stops calling it an
                      ordinary button while it does nothing;
                  (c) INERT — the handler guard inside each onClick, which round 14 added and which
                      is the only one of the three that is actually the BEHAVIOUR.
                Belt and braces on purpose: (a) and (b) are what the user is told, (c) is what is
                true. Delete any one of them and the other two start lying.
                ⚠ AND (b) DOES ONE MORE JOB, off this file: lib/pointerGestures reads aria-disabled
                to decide these are not gesture targets, so a press-drag from the ⚙ gear neither
                rings one under the finger nor synthesizes a click on it. That job used to belong to
                the pointer-events-none this round removed — see NOT_OFFERED_BTN_CLASS. So the
                attribute is load-bearing twice over; it is not decoration you can drop for a
                `title` or a tooltip.
                ⚠ aria-disabled AND NOT `disabled`, decided on evidence and not on taste:
                  • It is already this app's convention — PillGroup, PillTray, SliderValueEditor and
                    MethodBreakdown's Show Codes all withhold with aria-disabled, and index.css
                    names `.btn-solid[aria-disabled="true"]` FIRST in its unavailable rule. The one
                    real `disabled` is Check for updates, which is a different thing: momentarily
                    busy, not conditionally meaningless.
                  • A real `disabled` DROPS FOCUS when it is applied to the focused element. These
                    three go dim as a RESULT of being pressed — press Reset Settings and it dims
                    itself — so a keyboard user would be thrown back to <body> by their own
                    successful action. aria-disabled leaves focus where it is and re-announces.
                  • It keeps them discoverable. `disabled` removes them from the tab order outright,
                    which trades "reachable but silent" for "not there at all"; the complaint this
                    fixes is the silence, not the reachability.
                  • And it keeps the guards TESTABLE: jsdom refuses to dispatch activation on a real
                    `disabled` button, so the net could no longer ask what pressing a dimmed button
                    does — the exact question round 14's guards exist to answer.
                Save Defaults is constructive → btn-solid purple (the Begin-button language),
                keeping rose exclusively for the two destructive neighbors. It dims when live state
                already equals the saved defaults (factory when none saved) — nothing new to save.
                Each caption sits in a data-fitlabel span (whitespace-nowrap so it MEASURES at full
                width instead of wrapping; overflow-hidden on the button contains the pre-fit
                paint). */}

              position. It is stated here, at the top of the footer, because it applies to the
              metadata row below and to Contact — the saved-defaults pair is no longer part of it
              (round 21 — see the row directly below). */}

              moved up here round 20; restyled round 21). It is now two plain EQUAL-WIDTH PILL
              BUTTONS filling the row directly under the three-button trio — the RESET_BTN_CLASS pill
              geometry (px-3 py-1.5 rounded-xl border, text-xs font-medium, the border-transparent
              rendered-height rule) on the neutral `surface-toggle` surface, NOT the rose fill: View
              only navigates and Clear only OPENS a confirm, so neither is a destructive act in its
              own right (the same reasoning that keeps PresetManager's ✕ off the rose fill). They
              replaced the retired three-thirds overlap grid — two links centred on the row's 1/3
              and 2/3 so they interlocked with the trio's gaps — which round 20 had already reduced
              to an unconditional two-column split and which was tight to the point of the rings
              overlapping on a narrow phone. Plain flex-1 siblings with a small gap have none of
              that cost and read as one control tier with the trio above.
              Order is unchanged: View LEFT of Clear, matching the trio's left→right escalation.
              Both are ALWAYS MOUNTED (round 20). View Saved Defaults opens the defaults manager
              on its clearly-labelled FACTORY view when nothing is saved. Clear Saved Defaults opens
              a small CONFIRM modal (one red-tier Clear button, above) rather than firing
              immediately — and with nothing saved there is nothing FOR it to clear, so it DIMS AND
              LOCKS instead of disappearing: the identical three-part convention the three buttons
              above it withhold with (see the Reset Settings button's own comment) —
              NOT_OFFERED_BTN_CLASS draws it unavailable, aria-disabled announces it, and the
              onClick guard is what actually makes it inert. The row is always reachable, unlike
              Save Defaults directly above it, which dims and locks whenever live == saved.
              data-drag-stay is inherited from the pinned footer container, so a drag-release on
              either still opens its modal with the panel staying up. */}

                    — an aria-hidden copy that only reserves width, and the live label stacked on
                    it. So the button is always exactly as wide as "Check for updates" (the longest
                    of the four by construction — lib/updateCheck pins it) and the Changelog link
                    beside it can never shift when the label changes. justify-items-CENTER splits
                    the slack evenly, so each shorter label sits centred in the gap between the Last
                    Updated stamp and Changelog rather than hugging one edge (owner's call
                    2026-08-02, overriding an earlier justify-items-start that anchored them left).
                    The resting label is the widest, so it fills the cell exactly and centring
                    cannot move it — only the three status labels shift, which is the whole point.
                    Note that THIS centring is inside the button's own fixed cell and is a separate
                    question from where the button sits in the row: the row's justify-between is
                    what places the button (halfway between the stamp and Changelog, and a wider
                    date does move it there — as a whole, still halfway), while the strut is what
                    guarantees the label inside can never be the thing that moves anything.
                  • UNDERLINE ONLY AT REST. The other three labels are STATUS, not actions; wearing
                    the interaction signal while not being the interaction is the round-3
                    block-hover mistake. The button still IS pressable during a result — a tap
                    starts another check — but it is not offering the same thing, so it does not
                    claim to.
                  • DISABLED while checking, so the state the label reports is the state the control
                    is in. The NATIVE disabled attribute, deliberately — the suite pins `.disabled`
                    and a swap to aria-disabled fails there on purpose. No aria-live: a tap leaves
                    focus on the button, where the accessible name changing is announced anyway, and
                    a live region inside a control double-announces on some screen readers — an
                    unverifiable trade for no gain. */}

            {/* Changelog, RIGHT of Check for updates — the two update-flavored links live
                together, force-the-latest then read-what-changed — and LAST in the row, which is
                now also the row's right ANCHOR (see the row's own comment): justify-between pins
                this element's trailing edge to the panel's, and "this element" means the text plus
                the dot slot, not the word alone. Same footer-link recipe as the other three;
                wears the INLINE UpdateDot until its first tap after a build change — the
                second stage of the breadcrumb the gear's dot starts. ⚠ Since 2026-08-10 that dot
                appears only when the changelog actually GAINED something, so an internal deploy
                lights the gear and leaves this one dark.
                Round 8 rebuilt that marker: a text link reserves no room for the gear's corner
                badge, so the round-6 shared recipe put the dot on top of the word. The link is an
                inline-flex row now — the text in its own span, the marker its sibling — and the
                underline moved ONTO that span so the rule can never paint across the gap. The
                marker's slot is reserved lit or not (index.css), so lighting up shifts nothing;
                being aria-hidden, it needs the sr-only word beside it to reach a screen reader,
                which is also the only update signal left once the gear's dot has been retired.
                ⚠ That word carries its own COMMA rather than the gear's "(update)" parenthetical:
                the name-from-content algorithm trims each child's text before joining them, so a
                leading space is dropped and the two would run together ("Changelog(update)"). A
                printing separator is the only one that survives the join. */}
