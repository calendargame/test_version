// components/overlayStack — THE APP'S ONE STACK OF OPEN THINGS, and every rule about closing them.
//
// Everything a player can open and dismiss registers HERE and nowhere else: the mode menu and every
// other dropdown list, ⚙ Settings, every popup (the ⚙ popups, each confirmation, the run breakdown,
// the storage-full notice), Show Codes and How-to-Play. So this module holds the only answer to
// "what is open, and in what order" — and the three dismiss gestures, the dim and the keyboard all
// read that one answer:
//   • BACK (Android hardware Back, a browser's Back, a back-swipe) closes the TOP entry.
//   • ESCAPE closes the top LAYER — one press, one layer, newest first.
//   • A PRESS OUTSIDE closes the top layer only, never the one under it as well.
//   • THE DIM is painted by the top popup alone, so two popups never darken the page twice.
//   • THE KEYBOARD STAYS IN WHAT IS OPEN. While a popup, the ⚙ menu or a dropdown list is open the
//     page behind it is out of the keyboard's reach — no key acts on it and focus cannot be on it
//     ("THE KEYBOARD'S REACH", below, and isPageCovered).
//   • OPENING anything takes the soft keyboard down (dismissKeyboard, in pushOverlay).
// There used to be one registry (Back) and three rules that each kept their own idea of what was
// open — a document Escape listener per popup, a press-outside listener per layer, a scrim per
// popup, and a DOM query for "is a popup up". Each was right alone and they disagreed the moment two
// things were open at once: one Escape closed a popup AND the popup under it, one tap outside closed
// a dropdown AND the ⚙ panel it was in, and two scrims dimmed the page twice.
//
// THREE KINDS OF ENTRY, one hook each (below):
//   • a PAGE STATE — Show Codes, How-to-Play. Part of the page rather than a layer over it, so only
//     Back closes it: Escape and a press pass straight through to the layers (useBackButton).
//   • a LAYER with no scrim — ⚙ Settings, an open dropdown list, and the preset manager's delete
//     question (a second view of its card). Back and Escape close it, and a press anywhere is handed
//     to it while it is the top layer, for it to judge inside from outside (useLayer).
//   • a POPUP — it owns the whole screen behind a scrim. Back and Escape close it; a press is its
//     scrim's business, so nothing under it is ever told about one (usePopupLayer; components/Popup
//     is its only caller, and draws the scrim).
//
// ── BACK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Everywhere WITH a Back affordance (Android hardware Back, desktop browsers, any Safari/Chrome
// tab), Back with something open should close it — not exit the whole app. So each open entry
// pushes ONE history entry: pressing Back fires `popstate`, which closes the TOP-most entry (the
// browser already popped its history entry). Closing something via the UI instead steps BACK past
// its entry with a guarded traversal (settle — one traversal however many overlays closed together)
// — the entry itself survives as a dead forward entry (a traversal cannot delete) — keeping position
// in lockstep with what's open. Every marker entry records HOW DEEP it is (entryDepth, below), which
// is what lets one rule keep that lockstep everywhere: the place in the history is never left
// deeper than the newest thing still open. When nothing is open, Back does
// its normal thing (leaves the app) — including when the page was reloaded with things open that
// did not come back, and so stands on their entries (leaveIfOwed, below). A single module-level popstate listener drives the stack, so
// nested overlays close one at a time, newest-first. In a browser tab the entries help beyond the
// hardware button — a back-swipe closes the overlay instead of leaving the site.
//
// The iOS INSTALLED app (home-screen PWA) is the deliberate exception (IOS_STANDALONE below). It
// has no Back affordance to serve, yet iOS home-screen apps honor edge swipes over the history
// stack: a back-swipe would "close" an overlay as a page-slide off a stale snapshot, and every UI
// close leaves a DEAD forward entry the next forward-swipe navigates into (the dead-navigation
// ping-pong), entries accumulating all session. Apple provides no gesture opt-out for home-screen
// web apps (w3c/manifest#1041, open since 2022; overscroll-behavior / touch-action never reach
// the system gesture), so the root-cause fix is to never CREATE entries there: pushOverlay skips
// pushState and popOverlay skips the traversal — pure stack bookkeeping — leaving the history at
// ONE entry forever, which makes both swipe directions inert (nothing to traverse to). Overlays
// still close via X / tap-outside / Esc, exactly as before. Android, desktop, and the iOS Safari
// TAB keep the old behavior byte-identical.

// open pushed an entry of its own, the old one would be left behind it for good: a dead entry that
// costs one Back press which does nothing. How to Play made that a steady leak, because it comes
// back open after a reload (store/sessionMode) and so pushed again every time — one more dead Back

// ★ ONE RULE: WHILE ANYTHING COVERS THE PAGE — a popup, the ⚙ menu, an open dropdown list — THE
// KEYBOARD BELONGS TO THE NEWEST SUCH THING, AND THE PAGE BEHIND IT CANNOT BE REACHED BY IT. The
// stack is the only thing that knows what is open, so the whole rule is kept here, in four parts
// that all read the same fact (the top entry with a `reach`):
//   1. THE PAGE'S OWN KEYS DO NOTHING (isPageCovered). They are window-wide shortcuts, not keys
//      sent to a focused control — the answer keys (0–9), the Game Actions (N, R, O, C, S, ← and
//      →) and Tab's "open the mode selector" in src/main.tsx's handler, and Lookup's ↑ / ↓ /
//      Backspace / Delete in components/LookupCard's — so keeping focus off the page (parts 2–4)
//      cannot stop them, and each of those handlers asks this one question instead.
//   2. FOCUS IS TAKEN OFF THE PAGE WHEN THE LAYER OPENS, and given back when it closes
//      (pushOverlay, handBack). Without this a button on the page that had the keyboard kept it:
//      press New, open ⚙ with G, and Space or Enter pressed New again behind the menu.
//   3. FOCUS THAT ARRIVES OUTSIDE COMES STRAIGHT BACK (the focusin listener below) — a screen
//      behind focusing itself, a script, a browser walking Tab somewhere this did not expect.
//   4. TAB AND SHIFT+TAB WALK THE LAYER'S OWN CONTROLS AND WRAP AT THE ENDS (the keydown listener
//      below) — every step of it the stack's own — so neither can walk out into the page.
// WHY NOT THE `inert` ATTRIBUTE on what is covered, which gives 2–4 for nothing: it also takes the
// POINTER and the SCROLL away from whatever wears it, and under the ⚙ menu and a list those belong
// to the page still — a tap outside closes the menu AND lands on what was tapped, and the page
// scrolls under an open list (components/CustomSelect's dismiss rule, an owner's decision). Only a
// popup's scrim already blocks both, and a rule that is one thing under a popup and another under a
// menu is two rules. So this is the keyboard's rule and it touches nothing else.
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY LEAVES ALONE is argued where the keys are handled (src/main.tsx): the mode
// letters, H and G replace or close what is open rather than reach behind it. And a control inside
// the layer keeps its own keys — the arrows along a setting's options, Escape, typing.

// overlay (0 with nothing open), the entries in between belong to nothing: step back past all of
// them in ONE guarded traversal, whose popstate the listener above swallows. Three things were
// separate cases before this was one rule, and each could leave a Back press that did nothing:
//   • a UI close — it steps back past the closed overlay's entry (and, in the same step, past any
//     dead one under it);
//   • the dead-entry bounce — Forward onto the leftover entry of a closed overlay snaps straight
//     back, however many such entries the move crossed;
//   • a reload with two things open — the overlay that came back took over the newest entry, and
//     the older one under it was left for the player to press Back through.
// ⚠ ONE TRAVERSAL IN FLIGHT AT A TIME. `ignorePop` is a single flag, so a second traversal asked for
// before the first one's popstate arrives would be answered by a popstate nothing was waiting for —
// taken for a real Back, and closing something. So while one is in flight this does nothing, and the
// listener settles again when it lands, from the depth it actually landed on.
// Never forwards: an overlay whose own entry is ahead of where we stand (its opening raced a
// traversal) is simply closed by the next Back, which is the right answer too.

// to switch one off (lib/textEntry's listeners argue the same).
//
// ESCAPE closes the top layer and stops there — capture + stopPropagation, so the press is spent
// and nothing under that layer, and no other handler in the app, sees it.
//   • A TEXT BOX OWNS ITS OWN ESCAPE. Every box in the app discards its edit on Escape, so while
//     one has the keyboard the press is left alone to reach it — the dismissal ladder's innermost
//     rung: the first Escape gives the field back, the second, with nothing being typed, closes the
//     layer. The test is lib/textEntry's opensKeyboard, so a slider (which keeps focus after an
//     adjust and has no Escape meaning of its own) never swallows the dismiss.
//   • A HELD KEY IS ONE PRESS. Auto-repeat would otherwise peel every open layer in a second.
//   • A PAGE STATE IS SKIPPED, not a blocker: with Show Codes open, Escape must still close the
//     layer that is open with it.
//
// A PRESS is handed to the top layer and to no other. It is `pointerdown` — one event per press
// for mouse, touch and pen alike. The older mousedown + touchstart pair reports one tap TWICE (the
// touch, then the mouse event the browser synthesises after it), and the second report would be
// read against a stack the first had already changed: one tap, two layers closed.

  // ★ OPENING AN OVERLAY TAKES THE KEYBOARD DOWN (round 18). The owner's rule, verbatim: "when the
  // keyboard is open, doing anything at all should close it". What he reported was AoX — focus the
  // run-length box, then open ⚙ Settings or the mode menu, and the keyboard just stays up over the
  // thing you opened.
  // THE ROOT CAUSE IS PLATFORM, NOT THIS APP: pressing a <button> does not move focus on iOS or
  // Safari, so the gear tap leaves the caret exactly where it was and the overlay opens UNDER a
  // keyboard. Desktop Chrome hides the bug because the button takes focus there and the box blurs
  // on its own — which is also why the fix is the RIGHT one and not a papering-over: it makes every
  // platform do what Chrome already did.
  // ⚠ AND THIS IS THE SEAM, not the five openers. Every overlay in the app already registers here
  // (see the note at the top of this file) — so this line is the rule stated once, for the overlays
  // that exist and the ones that do not yet, where patching openers is five edits today and a
  // forgotten sixth tomorrow.
  // ⚠ IT BELONGS TO THE OPENING, NOT TO BEING OPEN, and the difference is the whole reason it lives
  // down here beside the stack.push rather than up in the hook. Every box in the ⚙ panel is INSIDE
  // an overlay, so a version that asked "is an overlay up?" on each render would take the keyboard
  // off a year box mid-word and make the panel untypeable. Sitting after the already-registered
  // guard keeps the two facts one decision: a call that does not add an entry is not an opening and
  // must do nothing at all. tests/textEntryFocus pins that scope against exactly that mistake.
  // ⚠ AND IT KEEPS THE EDIT, because each box's blur is its OWN contract and this only runs it. The
  // five that commit on blur (both year boxes, both AoX run-length fields, every tap-to-type
  // readout) normalize-commit; the Lookup date box has no onBlur at all, so its text is simply left
  // standing. Either way opening something is not a discard — Escape is the discard, everywhere.

  // nothing is being handed over, and there will be nothing to hand back.

// it being replaced — and by which time React has removed what it drew.
//   • Only when the keyboard was left with the layer: still on something inside it, or on nothing
//     because what held it has just been removed. Focus already somewhere else — the press that
//     closed a menu has focused what it pressed — is left where it is.
//   • To what had it when the layer opened — the control that opened a popup, the button on the
//     page that was last pressed, the top-bar button the keyboard was on when G opened the ⚙ menu
//     over it — if that is still there, and within reach of whatever still covers the page. (The

//     count: Tab into the menu and Escape out left the keyboard on nothing.) A list remembered
//     nothing to give back (pushOverlay): a tap outside one must not pull the keyboard back onto

// ⚠⚠ OVERLAYS THAT CLOSE TOGETHER UNWIND TOGETHER — ONE TRAVERSAL, ONE IGNORED popstate. This once
// called history.back() once per closing overlay, each marked by setting the one `ignorePop` flag.
// That is only sound for ONE overlay at a time, and several routinely close in a single commit: G,
// or any mode letter, shuts the whole ⚙ panel with whatever is open inside it — and the preset
// manager's delete question makes that THREE entries ('settings', 'presets', 'presets-delete').
// Browsers do not agree on what three back() calls in one task mean:
//   • CHROMIUM RUNS ALL THREE, each with its own popstate (measured in a real browser). The first
//     cleared the flag; the second, arriving on the 'settings' entry with nothing registered, was
//     taken for the dead-entry bounce below and went back ONCE MORE — a fourth traversal, off the
//     app's own first entry: the app navigated away on a key press. (Two entries never showed it,
//     because the second popstate lands on a marker-less entry and does nothing — which is why
//     the third entry is what made it reachable.)
//   • jsdom COALESCES them into one traversal and one popstate, which is how the suite missed it,
//     and it leaves two dead entries behind. A counter in place of the flag would be right for the
//     first engine and would EAT the user's next real Back press in the second.
// One `history.go(-n)` is a single traversal in every engine, with exactly one popstate, so exactly
// one ignore is always right — and settle() (above) asks for exactly one, to wherever the newest
// thing still open is. The closes are gathered in a microtask: every cleanup of one React commit
// runs synchronously before it, so a whole panel's worth is gone from the stack before the one
// settle runs, and nothing a user does can come in between. (A traversal was never synchronous
// anyway — history.back() only queues one — so deferring the call moves nothing a user could
// observe.)
