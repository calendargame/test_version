// GuidePage / GuideSection — the How-to-Play tab: an accordion of documentation
// sections (each a GuideSection wrapping an Expander) covering every observable
// behavior on the site. GuideSection is the reusable open/close row; GuidePage
// lays them out with Divider separators and owns the toggle coordinator (Q8):
// per toggle it measures both affected panels, computes one distance-scaled
// duration for the shared clock, and — when the layout change would carry the
// tapped section off-screen or clamp the shrinking scroll range — drives the
// scroll per-frame on the panels' own clock and curve, so the slide and the
// travel read as one motion (the math lives in lib/accordionMotion).
//
// ⚠ THE SCROLLER IS HANDED IN (round 13), and that is a cost worth naming. Until
// then this component drove `window` — the guide released the app's clamps and the
// DOCUMENT scrolled it, so the thing to move needed no introduction. It now shares
// #appScroll with every other screen (the reversal is argued at `switchMode` in
// main.tsx), and an overflow div has to be named, so App passes `scrollerRef`. Every
// read below that used to be a window global — scrollY, innerHeight,
// document.scrollingElement.scrollHeight — is that element's scrollTop, clientHeight
// and scrollHeight instead. The arithmetic in lib/accordionMotion did not move a byte:
// it was always about "a scroller", and only its INPUT NAMES still say document.
//
// Extracted from main.jsx in Stage C, Step 4e. Rewritten for scannability — every
// section now leads with a one-line summary, then tight chunks / bulleted lists;
// no documented behavior was dropped. GuideSection is exported named; GuidePage is
// the default export.

// DOM ids for a section's two landmarks. panelDomId is first an accessibility
// contract — the header button's aria-controls points at the panel body, which
// carries the id — and the coordinator leans on the same ids to re-derive every
// element it needs at tap time (the wrapper for geometry, the body for heights)
// from nothing but the two section-id strings in state. That kept the whole
// component ref-free until round 13, when the scroller itself had to be handed in;
// it is still what keeps the SECTIONS ref-free, which is the part that scales with
// the number of sections.
const sectionDomId = (id: string) => `guide-sec-${id}`
const panelDomId = (id: string) => `guide-panel-${id}`

// startScrollWriter — the coordinator's per-frame scroll driver, pointed at the element
// the guide scrolls. Runs the SAME clock and curve as the panel transitions: durationMs
// is the very value stamped into --expander-ms (pre-multiplied by --motion-scale, so
// Reduce Motion passes 0 here), and accordionEase is the numeric twin of the panels' CSS
// cubic-bezier. rAF callbacks fire before a frame's style/paint, so the first callback
// lands on the same frame the CSS transition first renders — treating its timestamp as
// t=0 keeps writer and panels in step — and a 0 duration jumps straight to the end state
// on that first pre-paint callback: the snapped layout and the corrected scroll appear
// together (the Reduce Motion instant path, which also fixes the old teleport-past-max
// clamp). Any real user scroll input (touchstart/wheel) cancels the writer instantly —
// the user always wins — and the returned cancel function serves mid-flight re-toggles,
// leaving the guide for another mode, the app being backgrounded, and unmount (see
// scrollWriterRef below).
// ⚠ THE CANCEL LISTENERS STAY ON `window`, deliberately, now that the scrolled thing is
// not the window. They are not scroll listeners — they are "the reader touched the page"
// listeners, and a touch or a wheel anywhere on the screen means the same thing whether or
// not it landed inside the scroll box. Narrowing them to the element would let a wheel
// over the fixed bar, or a finger that starts on a panel's margin, run the glide on under

        <Lead>A training tool for working out the day of the week of any date, in your head.</Lead>
        <p>
          You're given a date and must identify which weekday it falls on — as quickly and
          accurately as possible. Dates on or before October 4, 1582 (the day before the Gregorian
          reform took effect) are treated as Julian, matching history — the Julian Calendar setting,
          on by default, controls this. Every later date is Gregorian.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Install and offline</Subhead>
        <p>
          It runs entirely in your browser and saves your progress on this device. Add it to your
          home screen to use it like an app:
        </p>
        <UL>
          <li>
            <b>iPhone</b> — Safari's Share button → Add to Home Screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Android</b> — Chrome's Install app / Add to Home screen.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
          Give the sheet a moment to show the app's icon before tapping <b>Add</b> — it can briefly
          show a generic placeholder while the icon loads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once it has loaded it works fully offline, with no connection needed to practice. A brief{' '}
          <b>loading screen</b> (the app logo) shows while it starts up.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is designed portrait-only. An Android install locks itself to portrait; on iPhone
          and other phones that still rotate, turning the device sideways brings up a full-screen{' '}
          <b>Rotate back to portrait</b> screen until you turn it upright again — any running Flash
          or Blitz countdown pauses while it's up, so an accidental rotation mid-round never costs
          time. Desktop windows and tablets are never blocked.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Updates</Subhead>
        <p>
          Updates take care of themselves: while you use the app, any new version quietly downloads
          in the background and takes effect the next time you open the app fresh. A short{' '}
          <b>updating screen</b> marks the change — it appears once for each new version, even when
          the switch already finished quietly between visits. Switching back from another app never
          triggers it; the update waits for a fresh open. To ask right now instead, the Settings (⚙)
          panel has a <b>Check for updates</b> link. It really does check: the link reads{' '}
          <b>Checking…</b> while it looks, then answers in the same spot — <b>Up to date</b> if you
          already have the newest version the site is handing out, or <b>No connection</b> if it
          could not reach the internet. The answer stays for a few seconds and the link goes back to
          normal. Only when there genuinely is something new does it install it there and then,
          behind the same updating screen (your saved progress is kept either way). A brand-new
          version can take up to about ten minutes to reach everywhere, so a check in that window
          can still answer <b>Up to date</b> — asking again a little later finds it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see what an update actually changed, the <b>Changelog</b> link right next to Check for
          updates opens a plain-words list of what recent updates changed, each entry dated and
          listed newest first — the dates use the numeric form of your selected format, and the list
          scrolls within the popup once it grows long. Its heading also carries the app&apos;s{' '}
          <b>version number</b>, dimmed in the top-right corner — that is the one to quote if you
          ever need to say exactly which copy of the app you have. Each dated entry covers a whole
          day: if a day brought more than one update, that day's changes are gathered under the one
          date. The list shows the ten most recent days that had an update — anything older than
          that is no longer listed. After an update, a small <b>light-blue dot</b> points the way
          there: it appears in the top-right corner of the gear button (⚙) until you open the menu,
          and just after the Changelog link's own text until the first time you open the changelog.
          The one beside Changelog appears only when this list has actually gained something since
          you last saw it, so it never sends you to something you have already read; the gear's dot
          marks every update either way. The gear's dot is separate from the small violet bar that
          marks modified settings (see the Save Defaults section), and the two can show at once.

        <Lead>How tapping, dragging, and each on-screen button work.</Lead>
        <Subhead>Tapping and dragging</Subhead>
        <UL>
          <li>Tap any button to use it.</li>
          <li>
            Press a button but slide your finger off before lifting and nothing happens — the tap is
            cancelled — so a misclick is easy to back out of.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the weekday answer grid you can slide between options: press one, drag to the option
            you want (it highlights as you move, including over an already-answered option), and
            release on it to choose it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mode selector at the top works this way too — press it and drag down to a mode, then
            release to switch (or just tap to open the menu and tap a mode, as before). Once it's
            open, five things close it: choosing a mode, pressing anywhere outside it, Esc, Tab (the
            same key that opens it — see Keyboard Input), and your device's Back button (described
            below). Starting a scroll by touching the page outside the menu is one of those presses
            outside, so that closes it — but a touch that lands on the menu itself is not, and
            neither is the page moving on its own: it stays put under its button in the bar while
            the page coasts to a stop behind it, and you can open it mid-glide.
          </li>
          <li>
            So does the Settings gear (⚙): press it and drag straight into the panel — it
            auto-scrolls when you drag near its top or bottom edge — then release on a setting to
            change it; the panel closes and the change applies. Releasing on a Year Range field
            opens the keyboard to type instead, and the buttons at the foot of the panel keep the
            panel open.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your device's own Back — Android's Back button, or your browser's back arrow or
            back-swipe — closes whatever is open on top rather than leaving the app: the mode menu,
            the ⚙ panel and its popups, Show Codes, or this guide. Press it again for the next layer
            down. (This is the phone or browser's Back, not the <b>&lt;</b> button inside the game,
            which walks back through dates.) Installed on an iPhone home screen there's no Back to
            press, and the app deliberately adds none.
          </li>
          <li>
            Timer sliders (Flash speed and both Blitz timers) — tap the value beside the slider to
            type an exact number of seconds instead of dragging.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sections of this guide open one at a time — opening a section closes the one before
            it. When a section opens or closes, the page scrolls along with the motion whenever
            that's needed to keep your place: instead of sliding off-screen, the section you tapped
            comes to rest just clear of the bar at the top, with its title fully readable. The last
            section or two are the exception — the page has already run out of room to scroll by
            then, so they settle wherever the bottom of the page allows.
          </li>
          <li>
            The guide holds its place while you're in the app: switch to a mode, play, and come back
            and the same section is still open at the same point on the page. Only a fresh start —
            closing the app and launching it again, reloading it, or a Full Reset — returns it to
            the top with every section closed. Switching to another app and back is not a fresh
            start: that keeps your place, here as everywhere else.
          </li>
          <li>
            Text around the app can't be selected or highlighted, so presses and drags always
            operate the game. The exceptions are anywhere you type (the Year Range, Lookup, and AoX
            run length fields, plus any timer value you've tapped to type), the contact email, and
            everything in this How to Play guide, section titles included — guide text selects and
            copies like a normal page.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
          It all works the same way with a mouse. The weekday answer grid comes in two layouts —
          labelled buttons (default) or the seven-dot logo layout — chosen under{' '}
          <b>Settings → Display → Input</b>; tapping and dragging work the same in either.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Loading dates</Subhead>
        <UL>
          <li>
            <b>New</b> — load a fresh date. In timer modes, only available after pressing Begin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Begin</b> — timer modes only (Blitz, Flash, AoX). Starts a round or run; the timer
            starts and the date is shown (Flash hides it after the configured duration; AoX hides it
            between solves only when One-by-One is on).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reset</b> — timer modes only. In Blitz, ends the current round and unlocks settings;
            in AoX, ends the current run. Saved bests are preserved either way. Press Reset then
            Begin to start a fresh round/run.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reset Stats</b> — casual modes only (Classic, Flash, Deduction). See below.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <Subhead>Reset Stats (casual modes)</Subhead>
        <p>
          Clears your stats and question history for the current mode (Deduction only resets the
          current sub-type's stats). Details:
        </p>
        <UL>
          <li>
            <b>Two taps to confirm</b> — the first arms it (it turns red and reads "Reset Stats?");
            a second tap within 3 seconds confirms. Tapping anywhere else or waiting cancels.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generates a new date when timing stats are visible, or when you've burned the current
            date (answered wrong, revealed, or shown codes); otherwise the current date is kept.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Flash, a mid-question Reset Stats always generates a new date and returns to dash.

        <UL>
          <li>
            <b>Back (&lt;)</b> — return to the previous date. The answer is shown and the card is
            locked; no stat penalty. You can go back through your entire history in Classic, Flash,
            and Deduction; in Blitz and AoX, through the current round or run.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every history entry shows the correct answer in green; a wrong guess appears as dimmed
            red alongside the green.
          </li>
          <li>
            While browsing back, a small <b>Q#</b> label at the top-right of the date card shows
            your position in history (e.g. Q3 = the third question viewed).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Forward (&gt;)</b> — move forward through dates you browsed past with Back. Forward
            history clears whenever you answer a new question, press New/Begin/Reset, or take any
            action that advances the date. Overriding while browsing back does <i>not</i> clear it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each entry remembers its date format and calendar system, so a back-then-forward round
            trip never alters how a date was originally shown.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <Subhead>Reveal, Override, and Show Codes</Subhead>
        <p>
          <b>Reveal</b> — show the correct answer without guessing. Counts as a wrong attempt. No
          penalty on unanswered dates while browsing back.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Override</b> — fix a mistake. Override any date in your history by browsing to it with
          Back/Forward:
        </p>
        <UL>
          <li>After a wrong answer: gives you credit with time recorded and adjusts your score.</li>
          <li>After a correct answer: undoes the credit and adjusts your score.</li>
          <li>
            You can also override the most recent past date directly from a fresh, untouched live
            question (any mode) — Override is enabled when the live date hasn't been answered yet,
            and tapping it flips your previous date's right/wrong status.
          </li>
          <li>
            A previously correct date flipped to wrong shows a green-and-red diagonal split:
            green-upper-left (originally correct), red-lower-right (now counted wrong).
          </li>
          <li>You can only override each date once.</li>
          <li>
            Overriding a wrong answer (however you do it) clears any wrong highlights; only the
            correct answer is shown.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>Override in the run modes:</p>
        <UL>
          <li>
            <b>Blitz</b> — override past dates after the round ends to adjust your score and saved
            bests. With Allow Mistakes off, overriding a correct answer to wrong during a round ends
            the round, just like a wrong answer; with it on, the round keeps going.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>AoX</b> — without Allow Mistakes, overriding a correct answer ends the run.
          </li>
          <li>
            In both run modes, if a round/run ended because you answered wrong, revealed, or showed
            codes, Override credits that question and it continues — picking up where it left off
            instead of staying ended.
          </li>
          <li>
            Override is <b>locked</b> when Save Stats is off in the casual modes (Classic, Flash,
            Deduction) — there's nothing to record. In Blitz and AoX it works the same whether Save
            Stats is on or off (the run still tracks internally; it's just not saved).
          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
          <b>Show Codes</b> — reveals the calculation codes for the current date. Counts as a miss
          only while the date is still unresolved; once you've answered it (right or wrong),
          revealed it, or are browsing back, opening the codes is just a review and changes nothing.
          Per mode:
        </p>
        <UL>

          <li>
            <b>Flash</b> — freezes the countdown so the date stays on screen while you study.

        <UL>
          <li>
            Any time of 60 seconds or more — a single solve, a computed average/median, or any Best
            — displays as "—". Times are still tracked internally and contribute to averages,
            medians, and best-tracking; only the display is capped.
          </li>
          <li>
            Saved solve times keep a rolling window of the most recent 1000 (older ones roll off so
            saved progress stays small), so after a lot of practice Avg and Med reflect your recent
            1000 rather than all-time. Within a single visit, every solve still counts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Formatting (WCA speedcubing convention)</b> — single times (Last) are{' '}
            <i>truncated</i> to hundredths (the third decimal is dropped, never rounded); averages,
            medians, and bests are <i>rounded</i> to the nearest hundredth. Truncating singles
            prevents fortunate rounding boundaries; rounding aggregates avoids systematic downward
            bias.
          </li>
          <li>
            One question = one attempt. Getting a question wrong then right still counts as one
            attempt, marked correct.
          </li>
          <li>When you set a new best, a small ★ appears next to the value to flag it.</li>
        </UL>
        <Subhead>Reading a stat box</Subhead>
        <p>
          Every stat box uses the same three signals site-wide, in every mode, and each one means
          exactly one thing:
        </p>
        <UL>
          <li>
            <b>A dash ("—")</b> — nothing has been recorded yet, but it will be. Accuracy before
            your first attempt, or a timing stat before your first correct answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>A blank box</b> — that group is hidden. The label stays so you know what it is.
            Hiding is usually just hiding: Score, Accuracy and Streak keep recording in every mode,
            and so do the timing stats in Blitz and AoX, so tapping brings the up-to-date numbers
            back. The timing stats in Classic, Deduction and Flash are the exception — hiding those
            genuinely stops the clock. &quot;Hiding stats&quot; below covers both cases, including
            what turning timing back on costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The whole strip dimmed</b> — nothing is being recorded at all. That only happens with
            Save Stats off, and it always dims the entire strip, never a single box.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
          So a blank box and a dashed box are never the same thing: one is a group that is hidden,
          the other is a number that hasn&apos;t happened yet. The two can appear together: with
          Save Stats off, a group you had already hidden stays blank while the rest of the dimmed
          strip shows dashes — your choice is still visible, and still there when Save Stats comes
          back on. (While the strip is dimmed the boxes don&apos;t respond to taps at all.)
        </p>
        <Subhead>Hiding stats (Classic, Deduction, Flash)</Subhead>
        <p>
          These casual modes let you tap any stat to hide it. Tapping Score, Accuracy, or Streak
          hides all three; tapping any timing stat hides all three. A hidden group's boxes go blank
          — the labels stay, and nothing else on the strip moves. Score, Accuracy, and Streak keep
          tracking in the background while hidden — re-enabling brings the same numbers back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Timing stats behave differently: timing pauses entirely while hidden — no times are
          recorded. Classic and Deduction start out this way, with their timing stats already hidden
          and paused until you tap one; Flash starts with them shown. When you turn timing back on,
          the current date is regenerated if still unanswered; if you've already answered wrong,
          revealed, or shown codes, the date stays until you advance. If any questions were answered
          while timing was hidden, a desync would arise on re-enable, so the three timing boxes
          merge into a single "Enable and Reset Stats?" confirmation — tap again within 3 seconds to
          confirm (turn on and full reset), or tap anywhere else to cancel.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Save Stats is off, the whole stats strip dims site-wide (every mode, including AoX)
          and every box that isn't already blank shows "—", because nothing is being recorded. The
          boxes also become non-interactive — toggling timing or scoring is disabled until Save
          Stats is turned back on, which prevents accidental stat desyncs. Turning Save Stats on
          while timing is also on regenerates an unanswered date for a clean start.
        </p>
        <p>
          When timing stats are off, leaving and returning to one of these modes preserves the
          current question exactly as you left it — same date, same answers, codes panel in the same
          state.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Hiding stats (Blitz, AoX)</Subhead>
        <p>
          Blitz and AoX hide timing <i>visually only</i>. Because a round's score and a run's
          average depend on timing, the clock never stops in these modes: tap Last, Avg, or Med to
          blank all three, and the times keep being recorded in the background — tap again and the
          same numbers reappear. There is no pause and no "Enable and Reset Stats?" step, since
          hiding can never cause a desync. Score and Accuracy always stay visible, along with Streak
          wherever the mode shows it — the score is the whole point of these modes. In AoX, hiding
          quiets the trio only while a run is going; a finished run always shows its result, since
          the average is what you ran for.

          <li>
            Letter and number keys are ignored while you're typing in an input field or when a
            modifier (Ctrl/Cmd/Alt/Shift) is held.
          </li>
          <li>
            <Kbd>Tab</Kbd> is the exception — it toggles the mode selector even from inputs (use{' '}
            <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> or <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> to leave an input first if you'd rather; the next
            note says what each of those does). Tab plus any modifier (Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Shift+Tab,
            etc.) passes through to the browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            In every box you can type into — the Year Range boxes, the AoX run length, every time
            readout you tap to type into, and the date box on the Lookup screen — those two keys do
            opposite things: <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> keeps what you typed and leaves the box,{' '}
            <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> throws the typing away and leaves the box. Whatever the box sits inside
            stays open — a second <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> closes that. What <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> puts back is the
            value the setting is really on: for a Year Range box that&apos;s the stored year, for
            the others the value the box held when you started typing.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Lookup screen, &quot;keeps what you typed&quot; means it runs the lookup:{' '}
            <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> answers the date and lets go of the box, unless it can&apos;t read what
            you typed — then it says so and keeps the box, so you can fix it without reaching for it
            again.
          </li>
          <li>Locked or already-pressed buttons are skipped, just like a click would be.</li>
          <li>
            Inside the ⚙ menu, once you've clicked one option of a setting, the arrow keys move
            along that setting's options and choose each one as you land on it (<Kbd>Home</Kbd> and{' '}
            <Kbd>End</Kbd> jump to its first and last, and the ends wrap around). What counts as one
            setting is the choice, not the row: Date Format is a single five-way choice, so the
            arrows carry straight from the Written row into the Numeric one — and Theme does the
            same across Dark and Light whenever Use System Settings is off, since that's when the
            five themes are one pick. A locked setting ignores the keys. None of these presses reach
            past the menu, so they never step the date behind it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reset Stats (<Kbd>S</Kbd>) only applies to the casual modes (Classic, Deduction, Flash);
            pressing it in Blitz, AoX, or Lookup is a no-op, since those modes have no separate
            Reset Stats button (their round/run Reset clears in-round/in-run stats; persistent bests
            update only when set).

      {/* ACCESSIBILITY (B4) — its own section, deliberately, rather than more bullets under
          Keyboard Input. The URL is printed in the book, so readers arrive cold with no way to
          discover what is supported by poking at it; a titled row in the accordion is findable and
          a bullet buried in another section's Notes is not. It leans on Keyboard Input above for
          every KEY (the arrow contract, Enter/Esc, the letter map) and never restates one — this
          section is about how the app is MARKED UP and what it does with focus and motion.
          ★ EVERY CLAIM BELOW WAS READ OUT OF THE CODE, and nothing here describes what a screen
          reader SAYS. Sources, in order: the named groups = PillGroup's role/aria-label (all six
          pickers pass a `label`; the Theme block's name follows Use System Settings, which is why
          the wording is "the setting you're changing" and not a fixed list); the four switches +
          both year boxes = their aria-labels in components/SettingsPanel; the gear = its computed
          aria-label in main.tsx; the dots = WeekdayAnswer's per-dot aria-label; the stats strip's
          two words = the sr-only spans StatPanel renders — "Off" beside an `off` cell's value, and
          "Stats are not being saved" at the top of the strip when `dimmed` (C1, round 16; both
          pinned in tests/statBoxSignals.dom). ⚠ THAT BULLET NAMES BOTH ON PURPOSE: the round-16
          review found the dim was the one signal of the three with no non-visual form, while the
          blank had one, and the section may not claim coverage it only gives to two of three. If
          either span goes, the bullet goes with it; the guide's Known-gaps list below is where a
          purely-visual signal belongs instead; the popups =
          SettingsPanel's four focus-on-open effects and the shared trapModalTab; the panel NOT
          taking focus = the absence of any such effect for settingsOpen; the accordions =
          aria-expanded/aria-controls here and in MethodBreakdown; the mode list = CustomSelect's
          open-state key handler; the motion paragraph = a full grep of --motion-scale, which now
          has SIX consumers — index.css's .expander rule, this file's own inline transitionDuration
          + scroll glide, the three `transition:background-color` surface fades, and .boot-d's
          bootPulse — so those are the only things the paragraph may claim, and index.css's own
          words for the rest are "Functional motion — the .bar countdown and the color flashes — is
          deliberately NOT scaled". ⚠ THE PARAGRAPH IS NOW A COMPLETE ACCOUNT, WHICH IT WAS NOT
          BEFORE, and that is exactly what makes it fragile: round 15 had to add a sentence naming
          two decorative things that ignored the setting (the boot dots and the button fade),
          because the token then had only two consumers. Round 16 scaled all four stragglers and
          DELETED that sentence — a claim that had gone false the moment the CSS changed. Anything
          decorative added without var(--motion-scale) makes "nothing decorative moves" false again;
          index.css's --motion-scale block carries the same list and the same warning. (An earlier
          round-15 draft said "sliding panels, fades, and this guide's own scrolling" when no fade
          was scaled at all; the word is honest now, which is why it is back.)
          ★ THE KNOWN-GAPS BLOCK IS LOAD-BEARING, not throat-clearing. Each line is a thing the
          code does NOT do, checked one at a time: button:focus{outline:none} is global
          (index.css) and .focus-ring has been a no-op since the Tab binding landed; index.html
          sets user-scalable=no on purpose; the < and > history buttons carry only their glyph and
          the mode-screen range inputs carry no aria-label (the DefaultsCard copies do); and the
          GAME SCREENS' dimmed buttons are opacity-60 + pointer-events-none and announce nothing.
          ⚠ THAT LAST ONE IS ABOUT THE GAME SCREENS, NOT ABOUT aria-disabled BEING RARE — the
          attribute appears in five places (the ⚙ footer's three buttons, MethodBreakdown's Show
          Codes, the locked ⚙ pickers via PillGroup/PillTray, and SliderValueEditor's accented
          readout). The ⚙ footer and Show Codes are the two the prose names as announced; the
          pickers and the readout are announced too but are also pointer-blocked, which is why the
          bullet is about the game's Reveal/Override/history buttons specifically. An earlier draft
          of this note claimed the footer was aria-disabled's only site, which the section's own
          Show Codes sentence — and GAP 4's exemption for it — already contradicted.
          If any of these is ever fixed, delete its
          line here in the same change. Overstating support would be worse than saying nothing. */}

          How the app is built for screen readers, keyboards, and reduced-motion settings — and
          where it falls short.
        </Lead>
        <p>
          This describes what the app does, not what any particular screen reader says about it.
          Wording varies between VoiceOver, TalkBack, NVDA and the rest, and the site hasn&apos;t
          been tested against each of them.
        </p>

        <UL>
          <li>
            Every picker in the ⚙ menu is one named group of choices, not a row of loose buttons,
            and it&apos;s named for the setting you&apos;re changing — Date Format, Input, Theme,
            Leap Year Chance, Jan/Feb Chance on Leap Years, Julian Chance. Landing on an option is
            choosing it; the keys that move within a group are under Keyboard Input above.
          </li>
          <li>
            The four On/Off switches carry their setting&apos;s name — Random Format, Use System
            Settings, Julian Calendar, Save Stats — rather than reading as four identical buttons
            called &quot;On&quot;. Both Year Range boxes name themselves Earliest Year and Latest
            Year.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ⚙ button says what&apos;s behind it: that a setting has been changed, and that an
            update is waiting, whenever either is true.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the seven-dot answer layout every dot carries its weekday name, so the dots offer the
            same seven named choices the labelled buttons do.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both of the stats strip&apos;s quiet signals say themselves out loud. A hidden stat box
            reads as &quot;Off&quot; rather than as a nameless gap — the box goes blank on screen
            and keeps its label, and the word carries that same fact to anyone who can&apos;t see
            the blank. And a strip dimmed because Save Stats is off opens with &quot;Stats are not
            being saved&quot;, so the dashes in it aren&apos;t mistaken for a strip that simply has
            no numbers yet.

        <Subhead>Panels and popups</Subhead>
        <UL>
          <li>
            The four ⚙ popups — Save Defaults, the saved-defaults list, the confirmation before
            clearing them, and the Changelog — are proper dialogs. Opening one puts the keyboard
            inside it, <Kbd>Tab</Kbd> and <Kbd>Shift</Kbd>+<Kbd>Tab</Kbd> cycle that popup&apos;s
            own controls and wrap around at the ends rather than wandering into the menu beneath,
            and <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> closes it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ⚙ menu itself is not a dialog — it&apos;s a menu hanging off its button, and it
            doesn&apos;t take the keyboard when it opens. <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> closes it, unless
            you&apos;re typing in one of its boxes, in which case the first <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> belongs
            to the box.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each section header in this guide, and the Show Codes button, states whether it&apos;s
            open and which panel it opens.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mode selector is a list of modes. Once it&apos;s open, ↑ and ↓ move through it,{' '}
            <Kbd>Home</Kbd> and <Kbd>End</Kbd> jump to the ends, <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> chooses, and{' '}
            <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> or <Kbd>Tab</Kbd> closes it. While it&apos;s closed, <Kbd>Tab</Kbd> is
            the only key that opens it.

        <Subhead>Motion</Subhead>
        <p>
          If your device is set to reduce motion, nothing decorative moves. The panels that slide
          open — the sections of this guide, and Show Codes — open instantly instead, this guide
          stops gliding when it scrolls itself, the short colour fade a button does under your
          finger arrives at once, and the three dots on the updating screen stop pulsing. Countdown
          bars and the right/wrong colour flashes are unchanged, because those are telling you
          something rather than decorating.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Where it falls short</Subhead>
        <p>Stated plainly, so you know before you try:</p>
        <UL>
          <li>
            Nothing on the site draws a focus ring, so on a computer there&apos;s no outline showing
            which button the keyboard is on. Inside a ⚙ picker the selection stands in for one —
            landing on an option chooses it, so the option you&apos;re on is the lit one — but
            inside the popups above, <Kbd>Tab</Kbd> moves with nothing drawn to say where it went.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pinch-to-zoom is switched off deliberately, to keep the app feeling like an app rather
            than a page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not everything is named yet: the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> history buttons are only
            their symbols, and the timer sliders on the Flash and Blitz screens have no name of
            their own (the copies inside Save Defaults do).
          </li>
          <li>
            Two kinds of greying out, not one. The three buttons at the foot of the ⚙ menu, and Show
            Codes, are marked unavailable while they&apos;re greyed. The rest of the game&apos;s
            buttons — Reveal, Override, <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> — are only dimmed, so they still
            read as ordinary buttons even when pressing one would do nothing.

          The ⚙ menu groups every setting into three categories, with the Save Defaults and Reset
          buttons at the bottom.

          <li>
            <b>Dates</b> — which dates get generated: Year Range, Leap Year Chance, Jan/Feb Chance
            on Leap Years, and Julian Calendar (+ Julian Chance).

          At the foot of the menu: <b>Save Defaults</b>, <b>Reset Settings</b>, and{' '}
          <b>Full Reset</b> (see the Data section); directly under them the{' '}
          <b>View saved defaults</b> link — joined, once you've saved your own defaults, by{' '}

        </p>
        <p>
          Each of those three buttons greys out whenever pressing it would do nothing — there is
          nothing to save, nothing to reset, or nothing left to clear. A greyed one really is
          inactive: it does nothing to a tap, a keypress, or a screen reader's press. You can still
          reach it with <Kbd>Tab</Kbd>, and it's marked unavailable rather than left looking like an
          ordinary button; on a computer the pointer shows the not-allowed cursor over it. (See

          Years always show in full, never abbreviated. Only DMY, MDY, and YMD orderings are offered

        <Subhead>Random Format</Subhead>
        <p>
          When on, it rolls one of the five formats per date in game modes only — your selected
          format is preserved underneath (the panels just lock visually). Lookup and the Last
          Updated timestamp ignore Random and always use the selected format; the timestamp uses the
          numeric version of whichever format you've selected.

        <UL>
          <li>
            In Classic, Deduction, Flash, and AoX (idle), any format change — the Random Format
            toggle or the Date Format pick — regenerates an unanswered date so you don't return to a
            previously-seen date in a now-mismatched format. This applies across all modes at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you've already wrong-guessed, revealed, or shown codes on the displayed date, the
            change is deferred — the burned state is preserved and the new format applies on the
            next date.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Blitz rounds and AoX runs — active or just ended — a format change resets the
            round/run when you close the ⚙ menu, so the round on screen always matches your
            settings.

          In game modes' Show Codes, codes appear in the order the date is read (left to right),

          The setting applies to the weekday modes (Classic, Flash, Blitz, AoX). In Deduction the

          Sunday sits in the centre. The dots are deliberately unlabelled — their positions follow

            Dates keep coming from the stored range until the year counts — but the menu notices the

            button&apos;s violet bar lights and all three buttons at the foot of the menu become
            active, the same as any other change. Finishing the year does not put them back: once it

            settle only when nothing is left that differs — so pressing <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> on a year you

          <li>
            Changing the range always regenerates the current date — but if you've already

          When on, dates on or before October 4, 1582 are treated as Julian, which has different

          This affects weekday calculation and the codes shown in Show Codes. October 5–14, 1582 are

            For Julian-eligible dates (October 4, 1582 or earlier), the date stays if you haven't
            wrong-guessed yet — the answer and codes simply update.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you've already wrong-guessed, the date regenerates and is added to your history with
            both your red guess and a green for the day that was correct under the calendar system
            in effect when it was first generated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each date snapshots its calendar system at generation, so revisiting an earlier question
            via Back shows the highlights and codes correct under the system in effect when that
            date was generated.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Blitz rounds and AoX runs (active or just ended), a Julian toggle resets the
            round/run when you close the ⚙ menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Lookup the setting changes no answer at all: a date on or before October 4, 1582 is
            shown in both calendars either way. It only picks which one Show Codes works through —
            and even then it defers to the date, since February 29 of a year like 1500 exists in the
            Julian calendar only.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <Subhead>Julian Chance</Subhead>
        <p>
          Sets how often a generated date lands in the Julian period (pre-Oct 15, 1582). Random uses
          the natural rate (depends on your year range, ~16% on the default 1–10000 range); 25%,
          50%, 75%, and 100% force higher rates. The listed percentage is the exact final rate of
          Julian dates, not a force probability. Changing the value always regenerates an unanswered
          date; burned dates defer like every other setting.
        </p>
        <p>The five options lock and fade in three cases:</p>
        <UL>
          <li>The Julian Calendar toggle above is off (no Julian dates can be generated).</li>
          <li>
            Your range is entirely post-Gregorian (minimum year 1583+), so no Julian dates exist in
            range.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your range is entirely pre-Gregorian (maximum year 1581 or earlier), so every date is
            already Julian and the setting has nothing to do.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
          Year 1582 itself contains both Julian (Jan–Sep + Oct 1–4) and Gregorian (Oct 15+ + Nov +
          Dec) dates, so any range that includes 1582 counts as mixed and the row stays unlocked.
          The previously-selected value stays visually selected while locked, so it's restored when
          the lock condition clears.

            you got it on the first try). Toggling afterward doesn't change that question's outcome
            but applies to the next. If you've already wrong-guessed, toggling does not regenerate
            the date — the frozen value sticks for the question. When off, the question doesn't
            update stats and isn't pushed to history (Back can't browse to it).

        <Subhead>Save Defaults (left)</Subhead>
        <p>
          Makes the current setup <i>your</i> defaults — from then on, the two Reset buttons restore
          these values instead of the launch ones. One snapshot captures:
        </p>
        <UL>
          <li>Every setting in the ⚙ menu (all of Display — Input included — Dates, and Stats).</li>
          <li>
            Four values from the mode screens: AoX run length, Flash speed, and both Blitz timers
            (Per Round and Per Question).
          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
          Nothing else from the mode screens is captured — Blitz's Per Round vs Per Question, the
          Deduction sub-type, Allow Mistakes, One-by-One, and the show/hide stat toggles always
          reset to their launch values.
        </p>
        <UL>
          <li>
            Tapping the button opens a confirmation popup where the four mode-screen values can be
            edited before saving — so you can make, say, a different Flash speed your default
            without changing the live one. As on the mode screens, tap the time readout beside any
            of the popup's three sliders to type an exact value; a value you've changed highlights
            in violet. The menu settings are captured exactly as they are. Cancel discards any
            edits.
          </li>
          <li>
            While anything the snapshot covers differs from your defaults, the closed gear (⚙) shows
            a small violet bar along its bottom edge, and the Save Defaults button is active; once
            everything already matches your defaults, the bar disappears and the button dims —
            nothing new to save. A year you have typed but not yet left also lights the bar, even
            though there is nothing to save for it yet — pressing Save Defaults then saves
            everything else and leaves the bar lit until the year is finished or dropped. Finishing
            it does not clear the bar either, unless the year you finished on is the one your
            defaults already hold: a stored range that differs from your defaults lights the bar in
            its own right. <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> is what puts a year you never meant to type back. The bar
            is separate from the light-blue update dot at the gear&apos;s top-right corner (see
            Updates in the first section), and the two can show at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your saved defaults survive Full Reset — that's the point: Full Reset restores{' '}
            <i>them</i>. <b>View saved defaults</b>, at the foot of the ⚙ menu (below the reset
            buttons), opens a popup with the same four rows as the Save Defaults popup, showing your
            saved mode-screen values (every menu setting is also part of the snapshot, captured as
            it was when you saved). The link is always there: before you've saved any defaults it
            shows the factory values instead, labelled as such.
          </li>
          <li>
            That popup is also where you edit your defaults directly. Adjust any row — here the run
            length is a tap-to-type readout too, like the timer readouts — and the changed value
            highlights in violet, the Close button becomes Cancel and Save, and a note appears:
            saving there updates only those four values, while every menu setting in the snapshot
            stays exactly as it was. Saving from the factory view creates your saved defaults, with
            the menu settings captured at their launch values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Clear saved defaults</b>, to the right of View saved defaults and shown only while
            you have saved defaults, is the way back to the launch defaults. It asks for
            confirmation in a small popup before it forgets the snapshot; your current settings are
            untouched. The links live in the footer rather than the Save Defaults popup because that
            button — and with it its popup — dims whenever everything already matches your defaults;
            the footer links are always reachable.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <Subhead>Reset Settings (middle)</Subhead>
        <p>
          Restores everything the snapshot covers to your saved defaults — or, if you haven't saved
          any, to the launch defaults. That is the whole ⚙ menu:
        </p>
        <UL>
          <li>Random Format off, Written MDY</li>
          <li>Input on Buttons</li>

          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
          …plus the same four mode-screen values Save Defaults captures: the AoX run length, the
          Flash speed, and both Blitz timers. That makes Reset Settings the exact mirror of Save
          Defaults — one copies your live setup into your defaults, the other copies your defaults
          back over your live setup — across the very same values the gear's violet bar watches, so
          a single tap clears that bar whatever changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It still leaves everything else alone: the other mode-screen choices (Blitz's Per Round
          versus Per Question, Allow Mistakes, One-by-One, the Deduction sub-type, and the show/hide
          stat toggles) and your stats and history. Restoring a mode-screen value while a Blitz
          round or an AoX run is going resets that round or run when you close the menu, exactly as
          a menu change does. No confirmation prompt — tap to apply. When everything the snapshot
          covers is already at your defaults, the button dims and locks, since tapping it would have
          no effect.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Full Reset (right)</Subhead>
        <p>Restores the entire site to its launch state:</p>
        <UL>
          <li>
            Wipes all stats, all-time bests (Blitz and AoX), Lookup history, and in-progress rounds
            and runs. Your stats, all-time bests, and Lookup history are saved on this device, so
            Full Reset clears that saved copy permanently.
          </li>
          <li>
            Resets every setting and toggle across all modes — both the ⚙ menu and the per-mode
            toggles. The menu settings and the four Save Defaults values (AoX run length, Flash
            speed, both Blitz timers) restore to <i>your</i> saved defaults; everything else (Per
            Round / Per Question, Deduction sub-types and toggles, Allow Mistakes, One-by-One, the
            show/hide stat toggles) returns to its launch value. The saved defaults themselves
            survive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Closes any open overlay (⚙ menu, codes, method breakdown) and switches to Classic. How
            to Play goes back to the top with every section closed, so nothing is left open behind
            you.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
          Requires two taps to confirm: tap once and the button changes to "Confirm?"; tap again to
          fire. Auto-cancels after a few seconds, when you close ⚙, or if you tap any other control.
          When every setting, toggle, stat, best, history entry, and live state across the entire
          site is already where Full Reset would put it, the button dims and locks since tapping it
          would have no effect.

          Stats in AoX always track — the clock never stops. You can blank the timing trio (Last /
          Avg / Med) with a tap while a run is going, but it's visual only, and a completed run
          always shows its result. Best average and best median are tracked independently — they can
          come from different runs. Beneath each best, the companion metric from the run that set it
          is also shown (e.g. the median from the run that set your best average). A{' '}
          <i>Same Round</i> or <i>Different Rounds</i> tag tells you whether your best average and
          best median came from the same exceptional run, or from two different strong ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bests stay honest under Override: a finished run's record follows its corrected stats —
          overriding away one of its credited solves (on the last question or while browsing back)
          restores the best that stood before the run, and a correction that changes the run's
          average or median updates its record to match. The score display freezes when a run ends
          and only resets after pressing Reset. Leaving AoX mid-run resets it; a finished run's
          summary is preserved when you return.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bests are tracked per exact configuration: AoX run length, Allow Mistakes, Date Format (or
          Random Format on its own bucket), Leap Year Chance, Jan/Feb Chance on Leap Years, Julian
          Chance, year range, and Calendar System (Julian on/off). Changing any of these creates a
          separate bucket — your previous bests remain stored and reappear when you switch back to
          that exact config.

        <Lead>Identify the missing piece of a date given the rest plus the weekday.</Lead>
        <p>
          Choose Day, Month, or Year mode. The displayed date follows your selected Date Format (or
          random format snapshot, if Random Format is on), with a fixed-width underscore placeholder
          where the missing piece would normally appear.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Day</Subhead>
        <p>
          Seven consecutive days are shown, each with a unique day code. The correct day can appear
          in any position. <i>October 1582:</i> days 5–14 don't exist (the Gregorian transition
          skipped them), so the valid days are 1–4 and 15–31. When the window can't fit seven days
          on one side of the gap, it shrinks to four — codes 1, 2, 3, 4 repeat at days 15, 16, 17,
          18, so a five-day window crossing the gap would have a duplicate code.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Month</Subhead>
        <p>
          Seven fixed boxes group months that share the same month code, so tapping any month within
          a box gives the same weekday for that date. Tap the box containing the correct month. The
          boxes are always in the same position. In leap years, January shifts into the Apr/Jul box
          (becoming Jan/Apr/Jul) and February shifts into the Aug box (becoming Feb/Aug); the other
          boxes are unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Year 1582 with Julian on:</i> a special layout applies because the Julian/Gregorian
          transition splits the year — January through September and October 1–4 use Julian (year
          code +1), while October 15+ and November/December use Gregorian (year code −2). October's
          box position depends on the day: for days 1–4 it joins Jan and Nov ("Jan/Oct/Nov"); for
          days 15–31 it joins Jun ("Jun/Oct"); for days 5–14 it's excluded since those dates don't
          exist. The other six boxes are arranged differently from the standard layout — practice
          carefully.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Year</Subhead>
        <p>
          Five consecutive year options. Each has a unique year code, so only the correct year
          matches the displayed weekday. The correct year can appear in any position.{' '}
          <i>With Julian on:</i> when the five-year window would cross October 15, 1582 (the
          Julian/Gregorian boundary), it shrinks to two years — the calendar's 10-day jump produces
          a +5 weekday shift across that boundary that breaks distinctness for any longer window.{' '}
          <i>February 29:</i> only allowed when the window contains at least one leap year
          (Gregorian or Julian as appropriate). Non-leap years still appear as options but trivially
          can't be the answer, since Feb 29 doesn't exist in those years.
        </p>
        <Subhead>Per-mode toggles</Subhead>
        <p>
          These are mode-specific, not in the ⚙ Settings menu, since they only apply to one
          Deduction sub-mode. Year mode adds <i>ab</i> Cross (left of Day/Month/Year) and Jul Cross
          (right); Month mode adds 1582 Only (right).

              <i>ab</i> Cross
            </b>{' '}
            (Year mode) — when on, the five-year window must cross a year ending in 00 (any 100-year
            boundary, both leap and non-leap centuries). Practice the <i>ab</i> code change
            mid-window. Disabled when your year range doesn't span any 100-year boundary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Jul Cross</b> (Year mode) — when on, the two-year window must cross October 15, 1582
            (the Julian/Gregorian transition). N=2 always. Disabled when the Julian setting is off,
            or when your year range doesn't contain 1582 plus at least one of its neighbors (1581 or
            1583).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Both Year toggles on</b> — each puzzle randomly picks (50/50) which constraint to
            enforce. The two can't both be true for the same window. While both are on, two-year
            puzzles are centred in the space the five-year layout uses, so the answer area and the
            buttons below hold still as the two layouts alternate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1582 Only</b> (Month mode) — when on, every puzzle uses year 1582, forcing the
            special split layout described above. Disabled when the Julian setting is off or your
            year range excludes 1582. When the answer's cell groups months from both calendars, Show
            Codes uses slash notation (e.g., 1/-3, Julian/Gregorian) for any value that differs
            across the cell's months; values that are the same across all months collapse to a
            single value.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
          A correct answer briefly pulses the chosen option green, and when the next puzzle keeps
          the same answer layout the pulse carries over onto it. When the layout itself changes
          between puzzles — a two-year window after a five-year one, or October 1582's four-day
          window after a seven-day one — the new layout appears clean, with nothing carried over.

          When the round ends, the correct answer for the current date is highlighted and your bests
          are recorded. A round ends when time runs out — the round countdown in Per Round, or any
          single question's clock in Per Question. It also ends if you give up on the current date
          with Reveal or Show Codes, or — with Allow Mistakes off — on a wrong answer or if you
          override a correct answer to wrong.
        </p>

          it ended on a wrong answer, a Reveal, or a Show Codes (in Per Question with Allow
          Mistakes, this includes a round that timed out on a question you'd answered wrong —
          crediting that answer resumes the round with a fresh question clock) — credits it and
          resumes the round: the countdown picks up where it left off (Per Round) or a fresh
          question timer starts on the next date (Per Question), and the round's bests aren't locked
          in until the round ends for real (so a misclick you fix doesn't update your bests).
          Override works the same whether Save Stats is on or off.

            Streak is hidden in Per Question only when Allow Mistakes is off, since there a wrong

            Best score and best streak are tracked independently in Per Round and in Per Question

            whether they came from the same exceptional round or two different strong ones. Per

            Lookup input is always numeric and follows your selected Date Format (m/d/y, d.m.y, or

            the Date Format rewrites the box into the new one: a date you have selected comes back
            written the new way, and if nothing is selected the box is emptied instead, since
            half-typed text in the old format would no longer read.

            The answer sits on three fixed lines below the input — the date, then its weekday — and

            <b>Dates before the Gregorian switch have two weekdays, and Lookup shows both.</b> On or
            before October 4, 1582 a date can be read in the Julian calendar or in the Gregorian one
            projected back, and the two rarely agree — so the answer names each: "Julian: Saturday",
            "Gregorian: Wednesday". Nothing is chosen for you, and the Julian Calendar setting makes
            no difference here. From October 15, 1582 onwards there is only one reading, and it is

            Some of those early dates exist in one calendar only — February 29 of a year like 1500
            is a real Julian date and no Gregorian date at all, because the two disagree about which
            years are leap years. That reads as "Gregorian: Does Not Exist", and Show Codes works
            through the calendar the date actually has.

            The history panel keeps your 100 most recent lookups: each new one goes on top, and once

            History rows say the same thing in short, so each stays on one line: "J: Sat · G: Wed"
            for a date with two readings, and just the weekday on its own for every other date. Tap
            a row to see it spelled out in full above; the row you tapped is tinted and marked with
            a coloured edge down its left side, so you can always tell which one you are reading.

            Nothing in Lookup is frozen at the moment you look it up: the answer and every history
            row are worked out afresh from the date itself, so changing the Date Format updates the
            answer and the whole list together — an older entry can never disagree with the one
            above it.

            October 5–14, 1582 never existed — they are neither calendar's dates, not an early date
