// The site-wide scroll-region treatment (round 7) — the ⚙ Settings recipe, extracted here so
// no scroll region can quietly diverge from it again (settings, the changelog popup, and the
// Lookup history list each once carried their own copy of parts of it, and each drifted). There
// is deliberately NO scrollbar CSS anywhere — the treatment is two halves, applied together:
//
//   1. The PADDING LANE. The card owns vertical padding only (py-4); the scroll region itself
//      carries the horizontal px-4. That puts the 1rem right padding INSIDE the scroller — a
//      text-free lane where the iOS overlay scrollbar paints clear of the content. (Padding on
//      the card instead would leave the scroller's right edge flush against the text, with the
//      scrollbar painting on top of it.)
//   2. The EDGE FADES. The fade-scroll-* masks (index.css) — top/bottom feathers that appear
//      exactly when content extends past that edge — driven by useScrollEdgeState below.
//
// SCROLLER_CORE_CLASS exists for the scrollers that need no lane of their own. The app's main
// container (main.tsx appScrollRef / #appScroll) fills the viewport, so its scrollbar already
// paints at the screen edge past the content wrapper's own px-4 — it takes the core without the
// lane (its fades still come from scrollFadeClass). And since round 23 the option list inside
// a dropdown's panel (components/CustomSelect): every option row carries its own 1rem of side
// padding, so the text already sits clear of an overlay scrollbar, and a lane on top would also
// widen the panel away from the hidden width-mirror that must match it to the pixel. Since round 13 that container is
// the WHOLE app: How to Play used to scroll the document instead and was exempt from this file
// entirely, and it is now governed code like everything else. tests/scrollRegionGuard.test.js
// fails the suite on any raw vertical-overflow literal outside this file, so every scroll region
// must come through these tokens — with no scroller left anywhere that the guard cannot see.

// don't stack across classes (see the index.css fade-scroll-both note). Branches carry their
// own leading space, the codebase's conditional-class idiom (a doubled space in a class

// ── The edge arithmetic — ONE owner (round 10 item B) ────────────────────────────────────────
// Everything downstream of "where is this scroller relative to its two edges" is derived from
// scrollEdgeGaps, and nothing re-derives it: the two booleans that drive the mask fades, and the
// continuous --shade that drives the boundary shadows and the guide's soft edges, all read the
// same pair of numbers. That is the whole point of the function existing. Before this round the
// same expression was written out three times (here, and twice in main.tsx's bespoke effect), and
// a progressive shadow computing "how far from the bottom" independently of the mask's atBottom
// was how the two would have started disagreeing: a popover that overflows by 3px is shadowless
// today because of the dead band below, and under a naive continuous rule it would have grown a
// permanent ~12% footer shadow while the bottom mask — still banded — stayed off. One boundary,
// two answers. Not possible from here.
//
// The gaps are px of unreached content at each edge, clamped at 0 so iOS rubber-band overscroll
// (negative scrollTop at the top, a negative remainder at the bottom) reads as "you are at the
// edge" rather than going negative.

// the user has scrolled fully to the end — and a footer shadow that never quite goes away is worse

// contradict each other: shade > 0 exactly when the edge is live. rampPx is --fade-h, read once
// per listener attach — CSS cannot do this arithmetic itself (calc() has no length ÷ length), so
// the number crosses into JS rather than being duplicated as a literal.

// opacity are paint-only), and it is skipped outright when the rounded value has not changed —
// which is most frames, since a scroller more than --fade-h from both edges sits pinned at 1 and
// one at rest sits pinned at 0. So there is no rAF throttle and deliberately so: scroll events
// are already coalesced to at most one per frame, and deferring the write by a frame would put

// ── Watching the SCROLL EXTENT, not the scroller's box (round 11) ─────────────────────────
// The edge answer is a function of THREE numbers — scrollTop, scrollHeight, clientHeight — and
// the platform only gives an event for the first. A scroll listener therefore covers exactly one
// third of the question, and the other two thirds change silently: a panel opens, a list gains a
// row, an animation grows a section frame by frame, and the indicators keep painting the answer
// to a question nobody is asking any more.
//
// The obvious guard — a ResizeObserver on the scroller — covers only clientHeight, and only on
// the scrollers whose box can actually change. That is the bug this replaces: the app's main
// container is `absolute inset-0`, so its box is pinned to the viewport BY CONSTRUCTION and no
// content change can ever resize it; observing it meant observing the one number that could not
// move. The settings popover has the same shape once its content passes the card's max-height —
// the flex child stops growing, and every further change is invisible to an observer watching it.
//
// scrollHeight is the CONTENT's height, so the content is what has to be watched:
//   • the scroller itself — clientHeight (a viewport rotation, a flex re-layout, --bar-h moving).
//   • each of its element CHILDREN — scrollHeight is their stacked height, so a child growing
//     (including once per frame through a CSS transition, which is what makes the fades track an
//     accordion instead of snapping after it) is the content growing.
//   • a childList MutationObserver — a child ADDED or REMOVED changes the same total while
//     resizing none of the survivors, so no ResizeObserver could see it. It re-observes BEFORE it
//     reports, because an arriving child has to be under observation by the time it grows, and a
//     removed child's own observation left with it.
//     ⚠ WHERE THAT THIRD MECHANISM IS LOAD-BEARING, stated exactly so nobody trims it after a
//     half-check: the only region whose children change today is the Lookup history <ul>, and
//     there the hook ALSO re-attaches (its `active` is the history array, so adding an entry
//     changes the identity the effect depends on). So today it is the belt to that braces. It
//     stops being redundant the moment a region has conditional children and an `active` that
//     does not change with them — a shape this file cannot see and a caller has no reason to
//     think about. Keeping it is what makes the three mechanisms cover the three numbers BY
//     CONSTRUCTION instead of by an audit of every call site, and an audit of every call site
//     silently going stale is precisely this round's bug.
// Re-observing is a disconnect-and-re-add rather than a diff: observe() on an already-observed
// target is idempotent, the child count here is small, and the alternative is a second copy of
// the child list to keep honest. onChange is called explicitly after it because a real engine's
// initial delivery for the newly observed targets is asynchronous and a removal delivers nothing
// at all — the caller must not have to know which.
//
// ⚠ The callback must not change LAYOUT, or the engine reports a resize-observer loop. Every
// caller here writes --shade (paint) and toggles a mask class (paint), which is why this is safe
// and why it must stay that way.

// ── WATCHING A SCROLLER'S EDGES, AND COMMITTING THE ANSWER IN THE FRAME THAT ASKED ──────────────
// The one way an edge evaluator is attached to a scroller: `evaluate` runs on every scroll and on
// every change of the scroll extent (observeScrollExtent above), and returns the detach.
// ★ INSIDE flushSync. An edge evaluator writes two kinds of thing: --shade, straight onto the DOM,
// and the fade-mask CLASS, which is React state. The browser dispatches a scroll event (and a
// resize observation) in the frame's own rendering steps, just before it paints — and React does
// not render an update made there until a later task, which is after that paint. So the shadow
// moved with the scroll and the fade arrived one frame behind it: a list scrolled off its top edge
// showed one frame with the shadow and no fade, and one scrolled back showed a frame of fade over
// nothing. flushSync renders the update before the handler returns, so both land in the frame that
// shows the scroll. It costs nothing on the frames that move no boundary — React bails on a
// setState to the value already held, so there is nothing to flush — which is nearly all of them.
// ⚠ ONLY FROM THE BROWSER'S CALLBACKS, never from a layout effect: React refuses a flushSync while
// it is already rendering, and has no need of one there (an update made in a layout effect is
// rendered before the paint anyway). So the caller's own first evaluation is a plain call.

// Scroll-edge state for one scroll region: which edges have content extending past them.
//   scrolledFromTop → feed the top fade mask
//   atBottom        → feed the bottom fade mask
// plus the continuous --shade written onto whichever boundary surfaces the host names:
// topShadeRef gets the top edge's strength (a layered header's elev-shadow-down), bottomShadeRef
// the bottom edge's (a sticky footer's elev-shadow-up). Both optional — the changelog popup has
// fades and no boundary surface at all. They are POSITIONAL REFS rather than one options object
// on purpose: eslint.config.js runs react-hooks/exhaustive-deps at ERROR, an object literal at the
// call site would be demanded in the dep array, and a fresh literal each render would re-attach
// the listener and the ResizeObserver on every render. Ref identities are stable, so the deps stay
// honest with no memo and no dependence on the React Compiler.
// `active` gates the listener. Truthy = attach; the effect re-runs whenever `active`'s IDENTITY
// changes, so hosts whose region mounts with content pass the content itself (LookupCard passes
// its history array — a change re-attaches to the freshly (re)mounted list) and overlay hosts
// pass their open flag. The DETACH CLEANUP snaps the flags back to the defaults (scrolledFromTop
// false, atBottom true) and the shades to 0 — the reset lives there, not in the effect body (a
// synchronous body setState cascades an extra render; react-hooks/set-state-in-effect fails the
// lint gate on it), so a closed region is already clean and reopening never flashes stale
// indicators.
// A scroll listener tracks the user; observeScrollExtent above tracks everything else the answer
// depends on — the region's own box AND its content (the history list gaining its tenth entry
// mid-view, or Show Codes opening in the card above it and taking the list's height with it). Both
// are attached by watchScrollEdges, which commits each answer in the frame that asked for it.
// A LAYOUT effect, matching the app-scroller effect in main.tsx that already argues the point:
// evaluated after paint, a region would show one frame with no fade and no boundary shadow before
// the indicators arrive. That frame is cheap to avoid and it is the frame the eye lands on when a
// popover opens.

// ── WINDOWED ROWS — a list of any length that only ever draws what is near the screen ──────────
//
// Lookup's history is unlimited, so its list can hold thousands of rows. Drawing them all costs
// time in proportion to the list on every render of the card around it, and the scroll itself
// stutters once the browser is laying out thousands of buttons it is not showing. So the list
// draws only the rows in and around the viewport, and stands in for the rest with two blank
// spacers — one above, one below — whose heights are exactly the rows they replace. The scroller's
// content is therefore as tall as the full list at all times: the scrollbar, the edge fades
// (useScrollEdgeState above reads scrollHeight) and "scroll to row N" all behave as if every row
// were there.
//
// WHAT THE CALLER OWES: every row the same height (Lookup's rows are one line tall by
// construction), each drawn row carrying `data-row`, the gap between rows written as a top margin
// on every row but the list's first (a `space-y` utility would also put a margin on the spacers),
// and the two spacers drawn from `padTop` / `padBottom`.
//
// HOW IT KNOWS THE GEOMETRY: it measures it. Row height and the row-to-row pitch are read off two
// neighbouring drawn rows, never written down as numbers — the app's root font is fluid, so a row
// is a different number of pixels on every screen, and re-measured whenever the scroller's box
// changes (a rotation changes the font, and so the rows).
//   • BEFORE THE FIRST MEASUREMENT it draws a first batch from the top; the measuring layout
//     effect runs before the browser paints, so that frame is never seen.
//   • WHERE NOTHING CAN BE MEASURED (a layout-free test environment reports every size as 0, and so
//     does a list that is not displayed) it draws EVERY row: correct, and only as slow as the list
//     is long.
//
// `revealIndex` / `revealKey` — the row the list is asked to show, and its identity (Lookup's
// selected row and its id).
//
// ★ WHAT MOVES THE LIST, AND WHAT DOES NOT — one rule, in three parts:
//   • A CHANGE OF WHICH ROW IS WANTED scrolls the least it has to for that row to be whole and clear
//     of the edge fades (scrollBandIntoView): arrowing through the history walks the list with the
//     selection, and a new lookup (added at the top) brings the top into view. The first reveal
//     after the list mounts CENTRES the row instead — that is coming back to Lookup, or a reload,
//     with a row already selected somewhere far down a long list.
//   • A SCROLL IS THE PLAYER'S. Nothing brings the wanted row back once they have scrolled away
//     from it — not until they pick another.
//   • A CHANGE OF GEOMETRY (the list's box resized — Show Codes opening in the card above takes its
//     room — or the rows themselves changing size with the font) KEEPS WHAT THE PLAYER WAS LOOKING
//     AT: the row at the top of the view stays at the top, and the wanted row is brought back into
//     view IF it was whole in view before the change. So opening Show Codes on the selected row does
//     not push that row out of sight; and a row the player had scrolled away from stays away.
//     (It used to answer every geometry change by revealing the wanted row — which threw a player who
//     had scrolled down the list back to the selection — while a shrinking box, which changes no
//     row's size, revealed nothing and let the selected row slide out under the fold.)
//     ★ EXACTLY, HOWEVER MANY TIMES IT HAPPENS — a window dragged to a new size is a geometry change
//     per frame. Two things make that true, and each was once a way the list crept:
//       – THE SPACERS ARE RESIZED BEFORE THE POSITION IS PUT BACK. The rows change size by
//         themselves; the two spacers are this hook's, drawn from the last measurement, and stay the
//         old size until React draws them again. Putting the position back in between sets a number
//         of pixels into content that is about to change height above the view: the browser then
//         keeps whatever row that showed in place as the spacer resizes (scroll anchoring), or cuts
//         the position short near the end of a list that is momentarily too short — and reports
//         either as a scroll, which is taken for the player's. So a reported resize commits the new
//         measurement first (flushSync), and only then moves the list.
//       – THE POSITION IS REMEMBERED IN ROWS, and a browser only ever holds a scroller at a pixel
//         position it can show: on a whole pixel, and no further than the end of the content. Read
//         back and divided by the row size at every change, that rounding adds up, and a list at
//         the very end comes back short of it. So the remembered rows are kept for as long as the
//         list is where they put it, and only a scroll that really moves it replaces them.
