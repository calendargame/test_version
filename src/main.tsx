    // entries claimed it after the symbol's last reader here had left, which is the exact lie an
    // index is supposed to prevent. When main.tsx no longer touches a module at all the entry says
    // so and lists the real consumers instead, so the pointer still earns its place. Re-audit against
    // the import block, never against these lines, whenever you move something out.
    //
    // Shared mode types (GenDate/FmtDate/FlashState/GameEngine/ModeProps/DedOpts) -> src/modes/modeTypes.ts.
    // NOT imported here: App names none of them. It passes props to the five mode screens and their
    // types are inferred from those components, so the contract is enforced without this file
    // importing it. Consumed by src/modes/* and the engine.
    // AoxBest / BlitzBest / SuddenBest moved to store/progress.ts (the persisted store owns them).
    // NOT imported here either — of that module App takes useProgress ALONE now. The three best
    // types are read by AoxMode, BlitzMode, components/BlitzBestRow and src/engine/{aoxBest,blitzBest}.
    // LookupEntry / addLookupEntry / moveEntryToTop / mergeForDisplay, and the two stores that split
    // Lookup's history into a permanent shared list and a session-only amnesic overflow, moved OUT of
    // store/progress entirely (round 20) to store/lookupHistory.ts — see that file's header for
    // why Lookup's history stopped being preset data. App takes useLookupHistory, useLookupSession,
    // addLookupEntry, moveEntryToTop and mergeForDisplay from it; nothing else reaches that module.

    // class — an asset whose bytes changed while its precache revision did not, which Workbox will
    // never re-download (scripts/precacheIntegrity.mjs now makes that unshippable at build time).

    // scrollTop written to it is thrown away. The link fires `load` a second time when the sheet is
    // in place, so this runs `fn` now when it already is (or when there is no such link at all —

    // ★★ DO NOT HOIST THE `import('./sw.js')` IN App'S SERVICE-WORKER EFFECT TO MODULE SCOPE.

    // expression makes it abandon the ENTIRE enclosing component, so while that call sits inside
    // App's body the compiler emits exactly one event for the whole of main.tsx — that error,
    // against App — and App is never memoised at all. Hoisting the expression out does make App
    // compile (measured: CompileSuccess, 271 memo slots, 68 memo blocks).
    //
    // ⚠ IT ALSO BREAKS THE APP TODAY, and the suite proves it: with App compiled, exactly 3 cases go
    // red. Their ACTUAL failures, read off the run rather than summarised:
    //     tests/saveDefaults.dom:115  expected 2000 to be 800   (useModePrefs.getState().flashMs)
    //     tests/saveDefaults.dom:133  expected 2000 to be 800   (the same, one case later)
    //     tests/settingsPanel.defaults.dom:840  expected true to be false  (offers().gear)
    // Two of the three are NOT gear assertions at all — Reset Settings simply did not restore the
    // saved defaults, and the gear line beneath is never reached.
    //
    // ★ THE ROOT CAUSE, ESTABLISHED BY CONTROL RATHER THAN BY READING (round 16 review). Delete the
    // `if(!settingsModified)return;` guard out of `pressResetSettings` (the round-14 dimmed-button
    // guard, ~line 1392) and, with the hoist still applied, all 52 cases in those two files pass.
    // So the compiled defect is that MEMOISED HANDLER closing over a STALE `settingsModified` and
    // bailing out: the tap does nothing at all, which is why one symptom is an unrestored pref and
    // the other is a gear that never clears. The RENDERED value is right in the same commit — the
    // case at settingsPanel.defaults:838 asserts the gear is lit and PASSES on the line before —
    // so this is the handler's closure disagreeing with what was drawn, not a wrong `settingsModified`.
    //
    // ⚠ TWO THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE THE CAUSE AND ARE NOT. Both were TRIED, on top of the hoist, and
    // both left the same 3 cases red — do not spend the afternoon on either again:
    //   • `prefsAtDefaults` (~line 402) going stale because its zustand selector closes over
    //     defPrefs. Replacing it with a raw `useModePrefs()` subscription plus the comparison
    //     computed outside the selector changes nothing. (That probe is sound: without the hoist it
    //     is 52/52 green, so compilation is the only differentiator.) An earlier draft of THIS
    //     comment named it as the blocker; it was wrong, and this paragraph is its correction.
    //   • `defPrefs` being stale inside resetSettings. Reading the effective defaults fresh from
    //     useUserDefaults.getState() inside the reset changes nothing either.
    // The guard is DORMANT while App is uncompiled, so nothing ships broken — the harm would be in
    // fixing the wrong thing. Whatever fix is chosen has to make the guard read a live value without
    // putting a write in render; that is the work, and it has to land BEFORE the hoist.
    //

      // ★★ THE STATUS BAR UNDER A POPUP — the app's ONE account of how the phone's status-bar strip
      // (clock / wifi / battery) gets its colour. index.css and components/Popup point here rather
      // than keeping a second version; there used to be two, and they contradicted each other.
      // THE DEFECT: a popup's scrim (`fixed inset-0 z-[60] bg-black/40`) dims the whole page but not
      // the status bar, which the phone paints itself — so a bright strip sat above 40%-darker
      // content, in the INSTALLED home-screen app on the owner's iPhone.
      //
      // ★ WHAT iOS ACTUALLY READS — ESTABLISHED ON THE DEVICE, 2026-10-01, AFTER THREE ROUNDS OF
      // GUESSING. A web app cannot SET the status-bar colour; the phone picks it by looking at the
      // page, and Apple documents nowhere what it looks at. So a diagnostic painted every candidate a
      // DIFFERENT vivid colour at once, on the real app's own elements, in the installed app, and the
      // owner read the answer off the bar. Every line below is a result from that phone:
      //   • a new SOLID strip fixed at the very top, ABOVE the scrim ……… the bar took ITS colour
      //     (a 14px one, and one as tall as the top bar — where the bar "blended smoothly into the
      //     top of the page"; and with all six candidates painted at once the strip's colour won)
      //   • the theme-color meta tag (set, and removed-and-re-added) ……… no effect
      //   • <html>'s background ……………………………………………………………… no effect
      //   • <body>'s background ……………………………………………………………… no effect
      //   • #root's background (a solid, fixed, full-screen layer) …………… no effect
      //   • the top bar's background ……………………………………………………… no effect
      //   • the scrim alone (what the app did) ………………………………… "full bright white"
      // THE RULE THAT FITS ALL OF IT: the bar takes the colour of the TOPMOST fixed layer touching the
      // top edge of the screen, AND ONLY IF THAT LAYER IS SOLID. With a popup up that layer is the
      // scrim, which is see-through — so the phone gets no colour from it and falls back to a bright
      // default, and it consults NOTHING underneath (the top bar, #root, <html> and <body> were each
      // painted under the scrim and each ignored). With no popup the topmost solid layer at the top
      // edge is the top bar, which is why a theme change has always re-tinted the bar live — and why
      // that observation, true as it was, pointed at the wrong element for a whole round.
      //
      // THE FIX: while a popup is up, the top popup's scrim carries a solid strip along its top edge
      // in exactly the colour the dimmed top bar already shows there (components/Popup draws it;
      // index.css's `.status-bar-dim` is its geometry). It is invisible on the page — same colour as
      // what is under it — and it is the topmost solid layer at the top edge, so the bar matches the
      // dimmed page. This effect's only part in it is the COLOUR: `--status-dim` below.
      // ★ CONFIRMED ON THE OWNER'S PHONE (v2.27.2, the installed app, 2026-10-01): "yes it finally
      // works… And no visual band at the top." The diagnostic proved a solid strip on <body>, above
      // the scrim, 14px or taller; the shipped strip differs in three ways — it lives INSIDE the scrim
      // (so a card can draw over it and a tap on it is a tap on the dim), it is 1rem tall, and its
      // colour arrives through a custom property — and that confirmation covers all three.
      // ⚠ ONE THING IT CANNOT FIX: the bar follows the page by a split second. The phone re-reads the
      // page a moment after it changes and eases the bar to the new colour; nothing a page does makes
      // it read sooner. Fading the dim in so the two move together was offered and DECLINED by the
      // owner — he does not want how popups appear to change for it.
      // ⚠ WHAT FOLLOWS FOR ANYTHING NEW: a full-screen see-through layer over the page (another kind
      // of overlay, a drag layer, a toast backdrop) becomes the topmost fixed layer at the top edge
      // and will turn the bar bright exactly as the scrim did, unless it carries this same strip.
      //
      // THE THREE ATTEMPTS THAT FED IT THE WRONG THING — kept because each LOOKED right, and a fourth
      // guess would have looked right too. Do not add a mechanism here that has not been seen on a
      // device; build a diagnostic instead (the one that settled this is public/sbtest.js in git
      // history, commit 1326cf4 — v2.27.1, test site only: one script, loaded only under
      // /test_version/, that painted each candidate a different colour for a few seconds).
      //   1. Round 21 — <meta name="theme-color"> → the scrimmed colour. Never consulted by the
      //      installed iOS app (above). The write STAYS, on its own merits: Android Chrome tints its
      //      browser chrome and its installed-app status bar from it, and Safari 15–18 read it in
      //      browser tabs. (Neither of those has been checked on a device by this project.)
      //   2. Round 22 — <body>'s inline background-color → the scrimmed colour, on the strength of a
      //      WebKit bug report about runtime body-background changes. Inert; deleted in round 23.
      //   3. Round 23 (v2.27.0) — <html>'s background → the scrimmed colour, with #root made opaque so
      //      the dimmed canvas could not show through the page. It rested on "a theme change re-tints
      //      the bar live, and re-stamping <html> is the one thing a theme change does that a popup does
      //      not" — but a theme change also recolours the top bar, which is what the phone was reading.

      // Bar height tracking. The htp-sticky-bar is position:fixed (chrome-style fixed
      // element above everything), so it has no natural effect on the flow of the
      // appScrollRef container below it. We measure the bar's border-box height here and
      // write it to a CSS custom property (--bar-h) on the document root; the scroll
      // container reads it via padding-top:var(--bar-h) so its content starts below
      // the bar instead of being covered by it. ResizeObserver fires on initial mount
      // and any time the bar's height changes (e.g., mode switch flips pb-2.5 in
      // guide mode vs none in game modes, or content reflows). Writing to a CSS
      // variable instead of JS-applying padding directly keeps the styling
      // declarative and avoids React state churn for a value that's not part of
      // application logic. syncBarHeight is the ONE writer of the variable, shared with the
      // scroll-ownership effect below: on a mode change the bar's height and the guide's scroll
      // range change in the SAME commit, and a ResizeObserver callback lands only after every
      // layout effect has run — so a scroll restore that trusted the observer would clamp against
      // a scroller 10px too short. Calling it directly reads the post-commit truth (the rect read
      // forces layout), which is why it's a callback rather than a closure inside the effect.
      // ⚠ THE THREE EFFECTS BELOW ARE ONE ORDERED CHAIN, and the order is the declaration order:
      // React runs layout effects top-down, so this one measures the bar, the scroll-ownership
      // effect positions against a document sized by that measurement, and the edge-indicator
      // effect evaluates against the position that left. All three are LAYOUT effects for the same
      // reason — a passive one anywhere in the chain runs after the whole chain and after paint,
      // which is one wrong frame. That is why this is useLayoutEffect and not useEffect: as a
      // passive effect it landed AFTER the edge evaluation, which then measured the first frame of
      // every cold start against index.css's placeholder --bar-h:57px.
      // ⚠ SUB-PIXEL PRECISION (round 10) — the measure is getBoundingClientRect().height, NOT
      // offsetHeight. offsetHeight is specified to return a ROUNDED INTEGER: on the owner's device
      // the bar is really 71.765625px tall and offsetHeight reported 72, so --bar-h — and with it
      // everything positioned from --bar-h — sat 0.234px too low. That was the whole of the
      // hairline he reported in How to Play (a faint line of the PREVIOUS panel's bottom border
      // touching the bar with no gap, gone after scrolling a hair further). SIX readers share
      // this one token and every one of them sharpens at once:
      //   1. scroll-padding-top on #appScroll (index.css) — where a control you Tab to comes to
      //      rest, a How-to-Play section header above all.
      //   2. GuidePage's docking line — where a section you open is glided to, and the line its
      //      dock tracker measures the open header against.
      //   3. .doc-fade-top's top offset — where the guide's top feather starts.
      //   4. the app scroller's paddingTop below — where its content starts, and so the line a
      //      docked section header's `top:0` sticks at (index.css .guide-head). Padding on a scroll
      //      box lives INSIDE the box, so this reader feeds that scroller's own scrollHeight and
      //      therefore its scroll range. (Until round 13 the guide released the clamps and this
      //      same padding fed the DOCUMENT's height instead; one scroller now, one meaning.)
      //   5. the settings popover's max-height calc.
      //   6. CustomSelect's open dropdown, which WATCHES this property: its trigger is in the bar,
      //      so a change here means the trigger moved and the fixed panel must re-measure.
      // Reader 3 is the structural one, and the reason this fix is a guarantee rather than a hope
      // about how a given renderer rounds: with an exact --bar-h the feather begins EXACTLY where
      // the bar ends, so it covers anything that could still bleed through. At 0.234px low there
      // was a band painted by neither the bar nor the fade.
      // ⚠ getBoundingClientRect() is TRANSFORM-AWARE — it reports the VISUAL box. The bar carries
      // no transform today and must not gain one: a scale on the bar would silently corrupt all
      // seven readers at once (animate a child instead).
      // ⚠ Do NOT "modernise" this into ResizeObserver's borderBoxSize (fractional too): this
      // callback is ALSO invoked directly from the mode-change layout effect below, where there is
      // no observer entry to read, so a rect read is needed regardless — and two sources for one
      // number is exactly the drift the ONE-writer note above exists to prevent.

      // ★ ONE SCROLLER, EVERY SCREEN (round 13) — and this is the REVERSAL of rounds 7-12, so the
      // whole trade is written out here rather than inferred from what is missing.
      //
      // WHAT WAS TRADED AWAY, AND WHY IT WAS. iOS's tap-the-status-bar-to-scroll-to-top targets the
      // ROOT scroller exclusively: an inner overflow-y div can never receive it, WebKit sets
      // scrollsToTop = NO on every overflow scroller it creates, and no JS event exists to
      // intercept the tap — so it cannot be detected, polyfilled or faked. Round 7 bought that one
      // affordance for How to Play by stamping <html data-doc-scroll> in guide mode and releasing
      // the app's three scroll clamps, so the DOCUMENT scrolled the guide while every other screen
      // kept the locked fit-to-screen box.
      //
      // WHAT IT COST, which is what reversed it. The mode selector lives in the fixed bar, and on
      // the owner's iPhone it would not open on the first tap while the page was still coasting
      // from a flung scroll — two separate designs were shipped at that, both PASSING in Chromium
      // and both FAILING on the device. He then established the fix himself, unprompted, by
      // testing the app's OTHER scrollers: "if I do a big scroll in the inner scrollable region
      // then lift my finger then press the mode selector while the inner part is still scrolling,
      // the selector opens first try while the inner region finishes scrolling." An inner scroller
      // coasting under a fixed bar does not fight a tap on that bar; a coasting DOCUMENT does.
      // So the guide moves onto #appScroll on the same terms as every other screen.
      //
      // ⚠ THE PRICE, ACCEPTED KNOWINGLY BY THE OWNER — do not try to soften it, and do NOT build a
      // replacement. Tap-the-status-bar-to-scroll-to-top is gone on How to Play, permanently and
      // for the structural reason above. He was offered a substitute affordance and declined it.
      // Safari's URL bar also stops collapsing on that page, because the document no longer
      // scrolls; also accepted, also not fixable from here. If either comes up again, the answer is
      // "yes, that is the deal we made", not a patch.
      //
      // What the reversal SIMPLIFIES is most of the rest of this section: one scroller means one
      // listener, one evaluate(), one scroll-position language, one set of edge arithmetic, and no

      //     clamped by the engine against the scroller's height, which is why the bar measure has
      //     to land first.
      //   • every other mode → TOP. Without it, leaving a scrolled screen would show the next mode
      //     from the middle.
      // syncBarHeight comes FIRST and applies to BOTH branches, because the bar's guide-only pb-2.5
      // makes a mode change a bar-height change in EITHER direction: entering, --bar-h feeds the
      // container's padding-top, which is INSIDE the scroll box and so part of its scrollHeight,
      // i.e. what the restored offset gets clamped against; leaving, a --bar-h left 10px too tall
      // pads the game screen it hands over to, and the edge-indicator effect below would read that
      // inflated scrollHeight and paint a bottom fade on a mode with nothing to scroll. The bar's
      // own ResizeObserver cannot cover either case — it fires after every layout effect has run,
      // i.e. a frame late.
      // FOCUS, guide only: the container is tabIndex −1 (see the JSX) and is focused on entry so
      // Space / PageDown / Home / End scroll the page immediately. A document scroller gave that
      // away free — the document is the default keyboard scroll target — and an overflow div does
      // not: without this, a desktop reader's first Space does nothing until they click into the
      // page. preventScroll because focus() is specified to scroll the target into view, and this
      // element's "into view" is the top of the very range the line above just restored.
      // It is the LAST focus write of the switch, deliberately: CustomSelect returns focus to its
      // trigger when an option is chosen, and it does so inside the click handler, i.e. before this
      // commit — so arriving at the guide from the mode menu still lands on the scroller. Nothing is
      // lost by taking it: Tab opens that menu from anywhere (a window-level shortcut), so the
      // trigger never needed to hold focus to stay reachable.
      // …AND IT IS GIVEN BACK ON THE WAY OUT, which is the half the focus write cannot be shipped
      // without. Focus is taken FOR the guide — it is what makes Space/PageDown scroll a reading
      // page — and every other screen is a form of controls where a scroll target holding focus is
      // simply wrong. Leaving it held also made the behaviour depend on which door the reader used:
      // through the mode menu CustomSelect's own focus restore takes it away as a side effect, but
      // H, the mode letters and Android Back do not, so one route left every game screen quietly
      // keyboard-scrollable and the other did not. blur() only when the container is the one holding
      // it, so a switch that has already parked focus somewhere real (the menu trigger) is untouched.
      // A LAYOUT effect so all of it happens before the browser paints the new mode. Nothing else
      // in the app moves this scroller on a mode change, which is what makes the restore safe —
      // there is no later effect left to overwrite it.
      // ★ THE RESTORE WAITS FOR A SCROLLER THAT CAN HOLD IT (whenAppCssInLayout, at the top of this
      // file). On a reload the reader's place comes back from sessionStorage and the session page
      // brings them straight into the guide — and on a fast, cached load React gets here BEFORE the
      // stylesheet is in the layout. Written then, the offset lands on an element that cannot scroll
      // and is thrown away; the reader opened at the top, and — worse — the reading closure below
      // then reported that 0 as their place, so the next hide parked 0 over the real one. So both
      // halves wait together: the offset is written, and the closure that READS the scroller is
      // installed, only once the scroller is real. Until then the remembered offset stands (it is

      //   • CONTINUOUS — the bar's boundary shadow, and in guide mode the two doc-fade strips, all
      //     via the 0…1 --shade written straight onto those elements. Strength is a function of
      //     position, so a stopped scroller is already at its final value, which is what killed the
      //     shadow that used to linger after the page had stopped dead.
      //   • BOOLEAN — the container's own fade-scroll-* masks, which are state classes and so still
      //     need appScrolledFromTop / appAtBottom.
      // ★ THE ONE PLACE THE GUIDE IS STILL DIFFERENT, and it is deliberate: in guide mode the two
      // booleans are pinned to their no-mask values inside evaluate() rather than computed. The
      // guide's edges are the PROGRESSIVE strips; letting the boolean masks paint the same two
      // edges as well would put a feather that snaps on at 4px of overflow on top of one that
      // ramps — reverting round 10 on the single page it was built for, while every shipped test
      // name kept passing. Pinning them here rather than branching the className is what makes that
      // one fact do both jobs: the masks stay off, AND entering the guide RESETS whatever the game
      // screen left in those booleans (React then bails on every identical write, so a scrolling
      // guide re-renders nothing).
      // The arithmetic is NOT written out here: scrollEdgeGaps and its two predicates
      // (components/scrollRegion) are the one owner of "how far is this scroller from its edges",
      // shared with useScrollEdgeState, so the shadow and the mask can never answer differently.
      // What stays bespoke is only that this screen has THREE shade surfaces (bar + two strips) and
      // a mode-dependent boolean, which the shared hook's two-surface shape does not cover; the
      // inner regions (popover, changelog, lookup, the defaults card) go through it.
      // Defaults: appAtBottom true / appScrolledFromTop false (no indicators on first
      // paint before scroll state is evaluated). The listener runs on every mode change
      // so it re-evaluates against new content and picks up the strips as they mount.
      // A LAYOUT effect, and the LAST of the three declared above, so React runs it third: the
      // first evaluate() of a mode therefore measures a bar already re-synced and a position
      // already applied, and the indicators are right on the FIRST painted frame. As a passive
      // effect it would evaluate after the paint, so returning to a scrolled guide flashed one
      // frame with no bar shadow and no top fade.
      // ★ THE BAR'S SHADOW HAS TWO INPUTS, AND ONE WRITER (paintBarShade). `edge` is the strength
      // the scroll position gives it — the effect below, the same on every screen. `yield` is the
      // share of that the bar KEEPS, which is 1 everywhere except How to Play with a section open:
      // there the open section's header docks flush under the bar, the text slides under the
      // HEADER's edge rather than the bar's, and the header wears the shadow instead (GuidePage's
      // dock tracker measures it and calls yieldBarShade; lib/guideDock is the rule, and proves the
      // two shadows are never on together). The two inputs arrive from two listeners on the same
      // scroll event, in no particular order — so each one stores its number and BOTH repaint the
      // product. Whichever runs second writes the final value, and it is the same value either way,

      //     for the guide, top for everything else), and fullReset owns it on a reset (it zeroes
      //     the scroller inline, and clears the guide's saved position with it).
      //   • THIS effect owns the load-time invariant, and since round 13 that is TWO writes, not
      //     one write plus belt-and-braces. `mode` starts "classic" for the first paint (a cold
      //     open then moves to the preset's Default Mode, a reload to its session page — round
      //     21), and html/body/#root are clamped in every mode now, so a non-zero ROOT scrollTop
      //     would permanently offset the fixed layout — the original concern, unchanged.
      //     ⚠ `appScrollRef.current.scrollTop=0` IS NOW LOAD-BEARING — do not trim it as the
      //     defence-in-depth it used to be. History scroll restoration on a reload replays the
      //     offsets the last session left, and the surface a reader could actually have scrolled is
      //     no longer the document (which can no longer move at all): it is this container. A
      //     reload from a scrolled How to Play hands its offset straight back, into a fresh
      //     instance that is painting from the top (Classic first, then whichever page the cold-open effect restores,
      //     whose own scroll ref is a fresh 0) — i.e. a screen scrolled to a position that belongs
      //     to a page it is not showing at that instant. Zeroing it here is the whole of
      //     "a fresh load starts at the top".
      //     rAF + setTimeout because iOS Safari applies that restoration AFTER the event fires.
      //     window/documentElement/body are still reset alongside (body has overflow:hidden so it
      //     cannot scroll, but a restore might try anyway).
      //   • A BFCACHE RESTORE (event.persisted) IS SKIPPED ENTIRELY (round 11) — the opposite
      //     case, and the reason the gate exists. `pageshow` fires for both a genuine load and a
      //     back-forward-cache restore, and a restore is not a navigation: the JS heap is kept
      //     alive, so the app comes back in the SAME mode with the SAME DOM it left. Whatever
      //     scroll offset the browser hands back is therefore the one that belongs to this layout
      //     — the reader's place in the guide, the player's place on a long game screen — and
      //     zeroing it is pure loss. That is exactly the mistake round 8
      //     removed from visibilitychange (come back, lose your place in How to Play), surviving
      //     in a second event; round 9 then built the guide's position preservation on top of it.
      //     The invariant above is untouched by the gate: a restore cannot smuggle in a stale
      //     offset, because the mode that produced it is the mode being restored.
      //   • BACKGROUNDING NOW MOVES NOTHING — a deliberate behaviour CHANGE (round 8), not a
      //     tidy-up. There was a visibilitychange→reset listener here calling this same reset(),
      //     which zeroes the inner scroller too: switching apps and coming back jumped you to the
      //     top of whatever you were reading. That was invisible for a long time only because the
      //     clamped modes rarely overflow, and round-7's guide doc-scroll made it unmissable ("come
      //     back, lose your place in How to Play"). Removed rather than special-cased to the guide:
      //     foregrounding an app is not a navigation, the browser runs no scroll restoration for
      //     it, so there was never a root-scroll invariant for this listener to defend — in EVERY
      //     mode. The guide's in-flight scroll writer is cancelled when the app is backgrounded
      //     by GuidePage itself, which is where that concern belongs.

      //   • THE DETECTOR (why it is a build-identity file and not a fetch with cache:'reload', not
      //     DEPLOY_TS, not registration.update()) — documented at length in lib/updateCheck.ts.
      //   • THE INTERACTION (the button's state machine, its 3s result window and the
      //     abort-on-close) — components/useUpdateCheck.ts, called by App below. ★ It must keep
      //     being called by APP: its abort-on-close is a useSettingsCloseEffect, which never fires
      //     for a caller that unmounts when the panel closes — the rule is stated in full at the top
      //     of that file, and the suite cannot enforce it.
      //   • THE APPLIER — applyUpdate, right here, because it is App's machinery end to end:
      //     setUpdating (the Updating overlay), updateReloadPendingRef (shared with the
      //     build-change flash below), makeUpdateReloadGate, markSkipBootHold and forceReloadLatest.
      //     Once it TAKES an update it is terminal: every route out of it navigates. (It declines
      //     one while a save is unsaved — see the ★ note at its definition.)
      //
      // The applier reuses the auto-update path wholesale: SKIP_WAITING to the waiting worker, one
      // reload through makeUpdateReloadGate so the MIN_UPDATING_MS visible hold is honoured and the
      // reload fires at most once, and markSkipBootHold so the boot it causes doesn't stack a second
      // artificial splash hold. That KEEPS THE OFFLINE COPY, which the old unconditional
      // forceReloadLatest destroyed every time.
      // forceReloadLatest is still reachable, and deliberately — but be exact about WHEN, because
      // the round-7 class is not it. It fires from inside this applier and nowhere else, on the two
      // ways the gentle path can fail to deliver what the check promised: no registration to hand
      // off to at all, or no controllerchange within UPDATE_HANDOFF_MS. Having promised an update,
      // the button must produce one.
      // The round-7 class — an asset whose bytes changed while its precache revision did not, which
      // Workbox will never re-download — is now handled a step earlier and better: round 11's
      // scripts/precacheIntegrity.mjs FAILS THE BUILD unless every revision in dist/sw.js is the
      // md5 of the file actually shipped, so such a build cannot exist to be installed. A client
      // still carrying one from round 7 is cured by the next deploy through this same gentle path
      // (its cached revision is the stale one, the new manifest carries the true md5, so Workbox
      // does re-download). What no client-side button can cure is an edge serving wrong bytes for a
      // correct revision: the check's own fetch would be served the same stale bytes and say "up to
      // date". That is a server-side problem and belongs to the deploy, not to this button.
      // ★ IT IS HELD WHILE A SAVE IS UNSAVED. Every route out of this applier RELOADS the page, and
      // a save the device refused lives only in this page's memory (store/storageHealth) — so applying
      // an update then would throw the player's newest answers away, by the app's own hand, under a
      // notice that told them the answers were being kept. The applier declines instead (returns
      // false — nothing is raised, nothing navigates) and puts that notice back up, which is where
      // the reason and the remedy are. The update is not lost: it is still there for the next press
      // once there is room, and a waiting worker is applied by the next real open of the app anyway.

      // reload → the splash shows only as long as the real boot takes → the app. Cold-open only — NO

      // build stamp (lib/buildStamp): every boot compares the stored stamp against this build's
      // DEPLOY_TS and then RESTAMPS — the one detection per boot, and where everything else that
      // reacts to a build change (the update-signal dots) hooks in. On a mismatch the SAME
      // Updating screen holds for MIN_UPDATING_MS — no reload; hold-end reveals the app — under the
      // auto flow's exact discipline: claim the #boot handoff synchronously (the boot-hold effect

      // (appCssApplied / app-css-ready — an unstyled Updating frame must never paint), and let the
      // updating effect below take #boot down only after the overlay commits. Two boots restamp
      // SILENTLY, with no screen: the first-ever visit (no stamp — nothing to announce) and the boot
      // right after the REAL Updating flow (skipHoldConsumedRef — that flow already showed the
      // screen ≥1s and its reload lands on a changed stamp by definition; without this suppression
      // every real update would be chased by a second screen back-to-back, the exact thing the owner
      // ruled out). If the auto flow engages during the hold (an even newer version already
      // waiting), hold-end defers to its reload (updateReloadPendingRef) instead of revealing the
      // app for a moment before the navigation.
      // The two update-signal dots ARE the PERSISTED flags (src/changelog), read live rather
      // than mirrored: the detection below marks the GEAR flag on every build change and the CHANGELOG
      // flag only when the newest entry actually changed (2026-08-10), opening Settings
      // retires the gear's (toggleSettings, immediately below), and the first tap on the footer's
      // Changelog link retires the link's — the two-stage breadcrumb to the changelog popup.
      // Declared HERE, above the effect that sets them.
      // ★ READ STRAIGHT FROM THE PERSISTED FLAGS — no React state, deliberately. These were two
      // useStates seeded from the flags and re-synced by setGearDot/setChangelogDot calls inside
      // effects, which is react-hooks/set-state-in-effect and a cascading render: commit → effect →
      // setState → commit again. The flags in src/changelog were always the source of truth and the
      // state was always just a copy, so the copy is gone. markUpdateDot/clearUpdateDot notify, and
      // these two re-render — the same UI, one commit earlier, with no setState anywhere.

      // (store/storageUsage's `warning`). It is the SAME dot, lit for either reason — but this reason
      // is not a stored flag: it is the reading itself, so opening ⚙ does not clear it (that clears
      // only the update flag, below) and it goes out by itself the moment usage drops back under.

      // THE ONE WAY TO OPEN SETTINGS, and the only place the gear's update dot is retired.
      // ★ WHY THIS IS A CALLBACK AND NOT AN EFFECT. The retirement used to be
      // `useEffect(()=>{if(settingsOpen&&gearDot){clearUpdateDot(…);setGearDot(false);}},[settingsOpen,gearDot])`,
      // which is a setState run synchronously inside an effect body — react-hooks/set-state-in-effect,
      // and a real cascading render (open the panel → commit → effect → setState → commit again).
      // The fix cannot go the other way and put the localStorage write in render: render must stay
      // pure. So the retirement moves to the EVENT that causes it. Opening is the trigger; an effect
      // watching the resulting state was only ever an indirect way of observing that event.
      //
      // ★ WHY A SHARED CALLBACK. setSettingsOpen has 11 call sites, but 8 pass a literal `false`
      // (mode keys, H, outside-click, Esc, drag-dismiss, fullReset, the Back button, the mode
      // selector) and cannot open. The 3 that CAN open are all toggles — the gear's onPointerDown,
      // the gear's onClick, and the G shortcut — and a toggle does not know which way it is going.
      // Computing `opening` here once, in one place all three share, is what makes "retire only when
      // opening" expressible at all.
      //
      // ★ WHY IT SETS A VALUE INSTEAD OF `v=>!v`. Because `opening` has to be computed ONCE and
      // then used twice — to decide the retirement and to set the state — and that is the whole
      // reason. It is behaviour-neutral: the gear carries BOTH onPointerDown and onClick (pointer
      // presses toggle on press; the click is kept for keyboard and tests, and lib/pointerGestures
      // suppresses the real one) and exactly one of them fires per interaction today.
      // ⚠ AND IT IS NOT A DOUBLE-FIRE SAFETY NET — an earlier draft of this comment claimed it was,
      // and that claim was FALSE. A browser delivers pointerdown and click as separate tasks, so
      // React commits between them and the click reads the handler rebuilt against the ALREADY-OPEN
      // state: `opening` recomputes to false and the panel shuts, exactly as `v=>!v` would. The two
      // forms differ only when both land inside ONE React batch, which is not how the browser
      // sequences them. If double-fire safety is ever actually wanted it needs a form that reads the
      // LIVE value at call time; this is not that, and must not be trusted as if it were.
      //
      // ⚠ ONE BRANCH OF THE OLD EFFECT IS INTENTIONALLY NOT CARRIED OVER: its `gearDot` dep ALSO
      // retired a dot that lit WHILE the panel was already open. That branch was dead under the OLD
      // model — gearDot was React state that only this file's mount effect could move, and that
      // effect runs while settingsOpen is still its initial false.
      // ★ IT IS NOT DEAD ANY MORE, AND THE READ ABOVE IS WHAT CHANGED THAT. gearDot is now
      // useSyncExternalStore over readGearDot, which re-reads localStorage on every render — and
      // localStorage is shared across TABS. A second tab of the app detecting the same build change
      // writes the flag; this tab picks it up on its next render for any reason, with no
      // notification needed. So a dot CAN now light with the panel open, and with the retirement
      // living only in toggleSettings it then stays lit until the panel is closed and reopened.
      // ACCEPTED AS A COSMETIC GAP, deliberately: closing it means an effect watching
      // [settingsOpen,gearDot] that writes storage, i.e. reinstating the cascading render this round
      // removed, to shorten by one panel-cycle a stale breadcrumb in a two-tab session. The live
      // read WIDENS this gap rather than closing it — do not repeat the old "markUpdateDot has two
      // callers, both mount-only" argument, which reasons about THIS tab and no longer settles it.

        //     skip-hold boot below suppresses only the SCREEN). ★ It STAYS that way deliberately:
        //     the Updating screen has already fired by this point and cannot be suppressed, since
        //     this same detection cannot tell a typo fix from a redesign. Dropping the gear dot
        //     would leave the app announcing an update and then acting as though nothing happened.
        //   • THE CHANGELOG DOT = "there is something new to READ", which is NOT implied by a build
        //     change. It used to be marked on the same line, and the comment that stood here claimed
        //     "the changelog still has news either way" — which was false, and v2.21.1 proved it:
        //     an internal deploy on a day whose entry already stated the day's net effect adds no
        //     line at all (rule 13's fallback sentence is a fallback, never an addition), so every
        //     player holding v2.21.0 got a breadcrumb leading to something they had already read.
        // The comparison itself, the migration case and why the newest entry ALONE is the right
        // thing to compare all live in changelog.ts beside CHANGELOG_SEEN_KEY.

      // on whichever screen was missed.
      // ★ THE FIVE, AND ONLY THE FIVE: the screens that hold a preset's DATA. The other two screens
      // hold none, so a preset switch leaves them exactly as they are — the owner's rule is that only

      //   • HOW TO PLAY reads no saved data at all. Its open section, its reading offset
      //     (guideScrollYRef) and the place parked for a reload (store/sessionGuide) are the reader's,
      //     whichever preset is open.
      //   • LOOKUP's history is shared by every preset (store/lookupHistory), so the row selected in
      //     it — and the box, the answer and the codes that follow from the selection — still name
      //     what they named a moment ago.
      // Full Reset is what returns those two to their launch state, and does it itself (fullReset).

      // emptied store; a switch must not, or it would wipe the preset it just opened).

      // just below does, right before calling this, so the switch's remount and its page change land
      // in the same commit. A Full Reset (the other caller) sets the page separately, to "classic".
      // useCallback with an empty dep list: every setter it closes over is a useState setter, stable

      // lands here, because the one thing all of them have in common is that the bytes underneath
      // the five mode screens were swapped. presetControl therefore takes no remount callback: there is
      // nothing for a call site to forget.
      // ⚠ store.subscribe, NOT a useEffect on the value, and the difference is load-bearing. zustand
      // runs subscribers SYNCHRONOUSLY inside the set, i.e. BEFORE switchPreset rehydrates the four
      // stores — and React batches every update made in one turn (18+ auto-batching, in a handler or
      // out of one), so neither half renders until switchPreset has RETURNED. The key bumps and the
      // four store reloads therefore land in ONE commit, and the screens' mount-time reads
      // (getInitialStats and friends) see the incoming preset the first time they run. An effect
      // keyed on activeId would
      // run a commit LATER, leaving one render in which the stores hold the new preset while the
      // screens still hold the old one; that render is harmless only for as long as no mode
      // screen's stat-mirror effect happens to re-fire in it, which is a dependency array's
      // business and not a contract anyone signed.
      // ⚠ THE COMPARISON IS activeDataId AND NOT activeId — store/amnesic owns that expression, and
      // owning it there rather than spelling it out here is the point. It answers one question:
      // WHICH BYTES are underneath the always-mounted screens — which preset, and which copy of that
      // preset's stats. Changing a preset's Amnesic value repoints the progress store without
      // activeId moving an inch, so an activeId-only comparison would leave the screens holding the
      // parked stats while the store held the session's, and the next answered question would write
      // one into the other: the same 500-cards-becomes-4 failure, reached by a different door. A
      // further repointing added later extends that one expression instead of this line.
      // ⚠ It still ignores everything ELSE: renaming or creating a preset, or changing some OTHER
      // preset's Amnesic value, all write to a store watched here and none of them may throw away a
      // run in progress.
      // ⚠ Round 21: the same subscription now also moves the current PAGE — but only when the
      // ACTIVE PRESET actually changed (`presetMoved`), never on a bare Amnesic
      // change of the preset you are already on (which changes activeDataId but not which preset's
      // page you want). The incoming preset shows its session page if it has one this session, else
      // its `defaultMode` — read via readStoredDefaultMode straight off that preset's own settings
      // key, because switchPreset fires this subscription BEFORE it rehydrates useSettings, so the
      // live store still holds the OUTGOING preset's defaultMode at this instant. switchMode then
      // records the resolved page under the now-active preset's id. There is no data-contamination
      // risk in setting the page — it is a screen selector, not stats — so doing it here in the
      // synchronous subscription (one commit, no flash of the old page) is safe.
      // ★ THE GUIDE'S PLACE IS NOT THE PRESET'S, so nothing here resets it. On the way out of the guide
      // switchMode takes the live reading offset into guideScrollYRef, as on any page change, and the
      // scroll-ownership effect puts it back whenever the guide is next on show — in whichever
      // preset. A switch between two presets that are BOTH on the guide changes no page at all, and
      // the reader stays exactly where they were.
      // ⚠ THE EXPLICIT scrollTop=0 IS FOR A GAME SCREEN THAT STAYS ON SHOW: both presets resolving to
      // the same mode, where `mode` never changes and the scroll-ownership layout effect — which
      // seats every game screen at its own top — never re-runs for the remounted screen. Gated on a
      // real active-preset change, so a bare Amnesic change of the preset you are already on is
      // untouched; and never on the guide, whose offset is the reader's.
      // ★ AND THE CASUAL HISTORIES ARE PARKED FIRST (parkCasualHistories; store/sessionHistory argues
      // the lifecycle). This is the one moment that can be done right: the outgoing screens are still
      // mounted, each still holding the stats copy it was mounted on, so each parks under ITS OWN
      // copy — and whoever caused the swap gets the last word after this returns (a preset delete
      // removes the deleted preset's parks; an Amnesic change discards the session copies'). The
      // remounted screens then read whatever is parked for the INCOMING copy: its own history, as it
      // was left earlier this session.
      // ⚠ TWO STORES ARE WATCHED, BECAUSE THE FACT LIVES IN TWO: which preset is the registry's, and
      // each preset's Amnesic value is the session's (store/sessionAmnesic). Either one changing can
      // move activeDataId, so both report here, and `seen` is what the last report left — a change

      //      snapshot.) `defaultMode` restores like any other value; it only takes visible effect on
      //      the next cold open / preset switch (main.tsx's boot effect), so pressing Reset Settings
      //      does NOT move the page you are currently on.
      //   22 or 21 COMPARED by the gear's "modified" bar: 13 plain settings + the 4 prefs + the

      //      darkTheme/lightTheme; 1 with it Off — manualTheme) + the 2 year-range TEXT MIRRORS +
      //      the preset's AMNESIC flag (round 22 — it was the one captured-and-restored value
      //      the comparison had never included, which made Save Defaults unreachable for an
      //      amnesic-only change; settingsAtDefaults below argues it).
      //      The dormant theme value(s) — one with Use System On, TWO with it Off — are never
      //      compared; settingsAtDefaults below says why at length.

      // 2 mirrors are compared but not saved (round 15). AMNESIC is the reverse — saved and
      // restored but, until round 22, not compared — and it IS restored by the line at the foot
      // of this function, so "one tap clears a lit gear" holds for it as it does for the mirrors;

      // count, but through a SECOND binding that only Reset Settings and Full Reset read, so a
      // half-typed year offered those two while the gear stayed dark and Save Defaults stayed
      // dimmed — three buttons, two meanings of "changed" (hazard HC2 of the map). Round 14
      // collapsed that to one definition by DROPPING the mirrors; round 15 keeps the one definition
      // and ADDS them back to it. All four offers read this one expression, so they cannot disagree
      // about a half-typed year — or about anything else. Do not reintroduce a second at-defaults
      // boolean to "just" cover one button; extend this line instead.

      // snapshot copies STORE values (openSaveDefaults reads useSettings.getState()), and a
      // half-typed "19" is not a value — there is nothing to save. So on a dirty box Save Defaults
      // is offered, saves everything else, and the gear STAYS lit until the box commits (blur /
      // Enter) or discards (Escape). The alternative — committing the boxes on the user's behalf
      // when he presses Save Defaults — would put a year he never confirmed into his permanent
      // defaults, which is worse than a bar that stays lit while a box is still mid-edit.
      // The theme trio is compared BY WHAT IS IN EFFECT, not by what is stored. Use System ON

      // differs", and that fires for real: flipping Use System OFF seeds manualTheme from the
      // theme already on screen (so the switch never jumps the look), so on a light-mode phone an
      // OFF→ON round trip parks manualTheme at 'light' against a 'dusk' default — every visible
      // setting back at factory, yet the gear's violet bar lit, Reset Settings and Full Reset
      // both offered, permanently. Comparing only the live pair is both the honest definition and
      // the fix, and it retires the whole class of dormant-value false positives.

      // ★★ AMNESIC IS THE LAST TERM, AND ADDING IT WAS A BUG FIX RATHER THAN A WIDENING (round
      // 22). Save Defaults CAPTURES the value (components/SettingsPanel's commitSaveDefaults writes
      // the live value into the snapshot) and both reset buttons RESTORE it (resetSettings above),
      // so it was always one of the values "your defaults" covers — but it was the one value this
      // expression did not compare. The consequence was not cosmetic: `settingsModified` is this
      // line's complement, and openSaveDefaults early-returns on it, so changing Amnesic and
      // nothing else left Save Defaults DIMMED and INERT — an amnesic preset could never be
      // saved as a default at all unless the player happened to move some other setting in the same
      // visit. The fix belongs HERE, in the one shared expression, and not in a second narrower
      // boolean for that one button: the note above spells out why three offers reading one line is
      // the whole design, and a private "…or amnesic differs" for Save Defaults would recreate
      // round 13's three-buttons-two-meanings hazard exactly.

      // delegates its entire settings restore to that same function. So every newly-lit offer has
      // something to do. isFullyReset reads this expression too, so Full Reset's dim follows for
      // free and for the same reason.

      // player's SAVED default when a snapshot exists — a preset saved on Full is at its defaults

        {/* ★★ THE BAR'S WIDTH BUDGET, MEASURED — and it starts as a BUG REPORT, because the bar
            this rebuild replaced did not fit. Numbers below are from a real layout engine (headless
            Chromium, the dev build) at 360×800, the narrowest-and-tallest common Android phone;
            the root font there resolves to 15.6px (index.css clamps it to
            `min(0.95rem + 0.4vw, 1.95vh)`, so it grows with HEIGHT as much as width — which is why
            the phones that break this line are narrow AND tall, never simply narrow).

            WHAT SHIPPED (three controls, wordmark included) — content box 328.81px, content
            341.69px, i.e. 12.88px of OVERFLOW:
                logo 24.00 + gap 7.80 + wordmark 135.05          = 166.84
                gap 7.80
                ⚙ 40.25 + gap 7.80 + mode 119.00                 = 167.05
            Nothing truncated because nothing may shrink (both groups are shrink-0, deliberately —
            see the RIGHT group's note); it simply spilled, leaving the mode selector 2.72px from
            the screen edge against a 15.59px gutter on the left. That asymmetry WAS the visible
            symptom, and it is why "just add a fourth control" was never an option.

            WHAT THIS ROW COSTS NOW (round 21) — the row structure is unchanged from round 20 (ONE
            flat flex container; three controls `shrink-0`, content-sized; the FOURTH — the preset
            switcher — `flex-1 min-w-0`, consuming whatever the other three and their gaps do not).
            What round 21 changed is ONE fixed cost: the mode selector's trigger is now pinned to its
            OWN dropdown's outer width (triggerMatchesDropdown, components/CustomSelect) — the
            owner wanted the closed button as wide as the open menu, and since the menu's rows use
            a bigger text tier and more padding than the trigger, "both size to content" could
            never have made them equal. So the mode trigger grew from 107.30px to 142.02px
            (+34.72), which is the measured outer width of its `width:max-content` dropdown
            ("How to Play" at the row's `text-[15px]` + `pl-4 pr-4` + ✓-column + `gap-2.5`, inside
            the panel's `p-1`). THE DROPDOWN ITSELF DID NOT MOVE — measured 142.02px both before
            and after round 21 (the `dropdownWidth` default stays `'content'` for the mode selector).
            FIXED (the three shrink-0 controls + three gaps, measured 360×800, root 15.6px):
                logo 24.00 + gap 5.84 + mode 142.02 + gap 5.84 + ⚙ 40.25 + gap 5.84  = 223.79
                                        └─ was 107.30 before round 21 (fixed sum was 189.08)
            FLOATS: the preset switcher gets whatever is left of the row's 328.81px content box —
            328.81 − 223.79 = 105.02px at 360×800 (down from 139.73px before round 21; the mode selector's
            +34.72 came straight out of here). The ⚙'s right edge still lands at 344.40 — 15.59px
            from the screen edge, matching the left gutter, i.e. the row still fits with no
            horizontal overflow (scrollWidth == clientWidth, measured, at both sizes below).

            THE PRESET SWITCHER STILL CANNOT FORCE AN OVERFLOW, and that is still structural: its
            wrapper is `flex-1 min-w-0`, so it can be squeezed all the way to 0 — the 4.5em floor
            (PRESET_NAME_COL) lives on the NAME CELL *inside* the trigger, under two `overflow:hidden`
            ancestors, so it clips rather than pushes. A growing fixed sum costs the switcher
            display room, never the row its fit.

            THAT COST TO THE NAME CELL WAS PAID IN THE SAME ROUND, not carried forward as a flag. The
            mode trigger's +34.72px came straight out of the switcher's flex-1 share (its trigger is
            ~105px at 360×800 now, not ~140px), which left the OLD 6em name-cell floor (~82px at
            text-sm) wider than the trigger's usable inner width once `px-2.5` + `pr-6` (the chevron
            lane) come out — so a near-floor name clipped UNDER the ▲▼ on the tightest 360-wide
            layout, and the live pixel cap (lib/presetNameWidth, which measures that cell's rect)
            read the inflated floor and let over-wide names through. The same round dropped PRESET_NAME_COL
            to 4.5em (~61px at text-sm), which sits inside the tightest usable width with margin —
            re-verified in the layout engine at 360×900, where the cell clears the chevron by 19px.
            The floor's full derivation now lives beside the constant in components/PresetSwitcher;
            nothing about it is left open. tests/topBar.dom guards the structural half (which
            children carry `shrink-0` vs `flex-1 min-w-0`) as class reads, which is the most a jsdom
            suite can do about geometry no jsdom suite can compute.
            ⚠ AND CHROMIUM IS NOT AN IPHONE. Glyph advances differ, the system UI stack differs, and
            ONLY THE OWNER'S DEVICE can confirm the real thing. What is claimed here is that the
            arithmetic is no longer guesswork, not that the phone has agreed. (All of the numbers
            in this block, round 20's and round 21's included, are a REAL headless-Chromium measurement of the
            dev build — not the paper arithmetic components/PresetSwitcher's own history warns
            against trusting on its own.)

            ⚠ --bar-h IS UNCHANGED BY ALL OF THIS, and that was checked rather than assumed — round 21
            re-measured it at 56.594px, byte-identical to before, because it only sets a
            `min-width` on the mode trigger (its height is untouched) and the width-mirror it adds
            is `position:absolute`, out of flow. The row's height has always been set by the pill
            controls (py-2 + text-sm + 1px borders = 37.09px) and never by the 19.5px wordmark that
            sat beside them. So index.css's hand-written
            placeholder `:root{--bar-h:57px}` is still right and MUST NOT be touched. If a later
            edit changes the bar's resting height AT ALL, that placeholder has to move with it or
            every cold start jumps by the difference before the ResizeObserver catches up — that
            exact bug has shipped once. The seven readers are listed at syncBarHeight above. */}
        {/* Bar (position:fixed): the bar is a CHROME-STYLE fixed element above
            everything, explicitly positioned at the viewport top with its own theme-aware
            bg-(--bg1). (Whether iOS samples it for the status bar colour is UNVERIFIED — the
            ★★ status-bar note above App's theme effect is the one account of that; an older
            claim here that it does was never sourced.) Sibling appScrollRef container
            (#appScroll) sits below it, position:absolute inset-0 with
            padding-top:var(--bar-h) so its content starts
            below the bar — in EVERY mode since round 13, the guide included.
            syncBarHeight elsewhere in App writes the bar's fractional rect height to --bar-h.
            Full width (no max-w) so theme bg + elevation shadow span edge-to-edge on
            screens wider than 480px; inner max-w-[30rem] wrapper holds the control row (it held
            the TITLE row until the wordmark came out — the budget block above says what replaced
            it, the <h1> below says what the name became).
            elev-shadow-down is UNCONDITIONAL — the bar is always this screen's top boundary, and
            how strongly it says so is the 0…1 --shade the edge effect writes onto this element
            (0 at rest, ramping to full over the first --fade-h of scroll). The class used to be
            toggled and cross-faded by a CSS transition, which is what left a shadow visibly
            fading out after a status-bar tap had already stopped the page dead.
            HtP-only bar pb-2.5: absorbs half (10px) of the 20px gap that sits between the title
            row and the first GuidePage panel. That gap used to be one mt-5 on the guide's
            wrapper; GuidePage's own root now carries the matching mt-2.5 instead, so the total
            stays 20px — but the visual "lock line" is centered between control row and first panel
            rather than sitting right at the control row's bottom edge. It is a GUIDE number, not an
            app-wide one: the game modes open on StatPanel's own mt-4 and Lookup on an mt-5
            wrapper, neither of which this pb-2.5 applies to.
            ⚠ The SPACE in `pt-5 ${` is REQUIRED — Tailwind v4's source scanner silently drops a
            utility glued directly to `${` when it appears nowhere else; without it the bar lost
            its pt-5 (20px) top padding and the whole site sat ~20px too high. Don't remove the
            space — tests/classGlueGuard.test.js now fails the suite on any glued class site.

                the bar for a name the player already knows). But it was ALSO the page's only

                the name — so deleting it outright would have left the whole app unlabelled to
                assistive technology, with a decorative glyph where its name used to be.
                So the name stays, twice over, and neither half is optional:
                  • THIS <h1>, sr-only. Same text, same role, same accessible name, so a screen
                    reader still opens on "Calendar Game" and every getByRole('heading') in the suite
                    still means what it meant. It paints nothing.
                  • THE <header> ABOVE, which makes the bar a BANNER landmark — the structural half.
                    A lone visually-hidden heading is the cheap version of this fix and it is not
                    enough: landmark navigation is how a screen-reader user reaches site chrome, and
                    the bar is now four unlabelled-looking controls with no visible title over them.
                ⚠ AND BECAUSE THIS IS INVISIBLE, THE SUITE MUST NOT LEAN ON IT AS IF IT WERE NOT.
                Five sites used to tap or point at this heading as "somewhere on screen that isn't
                the ⚙ panel"; a sr-only element would have kept every one of them GREEN while
                testing a target no finger can reach. They now use something visible instead (the

                tests/app-mount, tests/persistence and tests/presetSwitch. tests/topBar.dom pins the
                honest version of the claim: the heading exists, it is sr-only, and NO visible node

                  for coordinate, so turning the input and leaving the mark upright would break the
                  very claim How-to-Play makes about them — while turning the mark when there are
                  no dots ANYWHERE on screen for it to correspond to is a different bug, and the one
                  round 20 fixed: the setting alone used to reach this prop unconditionally, so a
                  player on Buttons could leave it on and the mark sat turned forever with nothing
                  on screen it matched. The `inputStyle==='dots'` test below is that fix. The four
                  weekday mode screens (and WeekdayAnswer through them) get the plain setting
                  instead, because they only ever consult it already inside their own
                  `inputStyle==='dots'` render branch and a second gate there would be dead code.
                  This is the ONE drawing of the mark that follows: the title bar is app chrome, with
                  no static counterpart on screen beside it. The three full-screen frames —
                  index.html's #boot, the Updating overlay and the rotate-back overlay — keep the
                  canonical standard form, because they stand next to (or back-to-back with) the
                  iOS launch PNGs that are pre-renders of #boot and cannot follow anything. That
                  is why W5Logo takes a ROTATION PROP defaulting to standard rather than reading
                  the store itself: the default IS the fixed brand mark, and a caller has to ask
                  for the player's. lib/dotLayout's DOT_MARK_ROTATION states the rest. */}

                  hard requirement rather than a preference, and — since round 20 — why its trigger is

                  no className from any caller, so THIS div is what stands in for it as the row's
                  flex item, with nothing between them for anything to disagree about — CustomSelect's
                  own div, `position:relative` and otherwise unstyled, defaults to filling 100% of
                  it (ordinary block behaviour, not a flex property). PresetSwitcher's OWN
                  `w-full min-w-0` on the trigger button is the other half of this chain — see that

                  the flip measured the space above against, so that space was structurally
                  negative and the branch was unreachable. This trigger is also WHY the panel can
                  be viewport-fixed and measured once per open — fixed chrome is the one place no
                  scroller can move it out from under the panel (see the caller contract at the
                  top of components/CustomSelect).
                  ⚠ pr-6, NOT pr-9 — one of the two cuts that paid for the fourth control (the
                  budget block above the bar has the arithmetic). The chevron is `absolute right-2`
                  and ~7px wide in both selects, so the glyph does not move: pr-9 was reserving
                  ~20px of clearance between the label and a glyph that needs ~8. pr-6 is what the
                  preset switcher beside it already wears, so the two now match by construction
                  instead of by coincidence. */}

                    for the settings modals (the Full Reset / Reset Settings / Clear confirms
                    among them since round 21).
                  • THIS POSITION. It is a sibling of the title/gear row inside the bar's `relative`
                    inner wrapper, and the card is `absolute top-full left-4 right-4` against that
                    wrapper. Anywhere else, or inside a wrapper of its own, and the panel silently

            its pb-3 under the content. Every child is a plain non-growing flex item pinned to the

            (a section-less guide, i.e. never) it would do what it does for Lookup.
